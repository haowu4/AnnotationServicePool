News: REPEAT MORE THAN GARLIC. The Eurogroup asks Spain for more fiscal and labor market reforms
The Eurogroup asks Spain for more fiscal and labor market reforms
Eurogroup president, Dutch Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has praised this morning in Riga, where European economic and finance ministers meet, the performance of the Spanish economy, but has called for more efforts. &quot;
The Spanish economy is recovering very well, and of course Spain has already made many reforms.
But much can be done on issues such as the labor market or tax reforms.
The government is working on it, &quot;he said at the entrance of the Eurogroup.
Although the main theme for months is Greece, the ministers of the euro will address this morning in Riga the case of Spain, with the presentation by the technicians of the Troika of the last report on our country, drawn up after the visit of the &#39;Men in black&#39; last month.
An advance has already been published, and the full text will come out next month.
What is known is that the report is very positive and recognizes the efforts and objectives achieved, but as usual indicates those areas where it sees room for improvement.
And in the Spanish case this always means the labor market, where they consider that there is too much duality and rigidity; The fiscal side, due to lack of income.
And the services sector, after reforms like the one of market unit, the commercial schedules or the professional services do not end up being profiled. &quot;
The work of the Commission, the institutions, is to always ask for more things, &quot;soften sources from the Ministry of Economy.
Spain is also not worried about the recent words of ECB President Mario Draghi, which was precisely on the weakness of the labor market. &quot;
From Draghi what we see are praises, &quot;they add from the Ministry.

Regardless of all the shit that comes out its measures are only aimed at exploiting more and more to the poor ..... Last edited by real estate manure; Apr 24, 2015 at 08:35
That they do them, we are the locomotive of Europe, growing to 3% and creating 500,000 jobs a year.
All ironic, of course
Well that will wait for after the elections: broken :.
If, as they say, the economy is recovering very well, why do we need more reforms?
This is what happens when you repeat mantras and do not do serious analytics.
The problem is not legislation.
It is the control of compliance with it.
In Greece there are tax laws, but they are skipped when they want, as here, with fraudulent or directly illegal instruments.
Post-election year is coming ...
Lower their salaries more, raise taxes and the cost of living.
If this does not mean &quot;you have to kill them faster&quot; expializes it to me.
They consider that there is too much duality and rigidity; The fiscal side, due to lack of income.
And the services sector, after reforms like the one of market unit, the commercial schedules or the professional services do not end up being profiled.
There is duality in the labor market YES or NO?
There is a lack of income because the public sector is mega-hit YES or NO?
There is no market unit (because Catalan and Andalusian legislation are different) YES or NO?
I honestly do not see where the Eurogroup is wrong.
He points out some problems that exist and says that we solve them.
The problem is that solution is used.
All are painful.
Being Ejpaña a model and referring to follow, as the Eurogroup has dictated, normal that demand to this, that follow the same course, without fainting applying the recipes that so much have harmed us.
Guindos says that the Eurogroup sees Spain as a &quot;benchmark&quot; and &quot;example&quot; of the policies to be followed
And Rajoy says ... &quot;Despuesh de lash Euro ... I say the generals&quot;
Those of the eurogroup that little trust the NEP ...
I anticipate an advance of the general elections ...
But if we are the most of the most Why more reforms?
I do not understand anything; Someone lies to us.
It seems to me that after the next general election, the eurogroup is going to have to put the recipes to this country by the ass.

Like every year, the day of the 24th was a very special day in the esplanade of Santa Domingo, a place where the Angels Malagueños de la Noche contributed, once again, their grain of sand so that no one was left without enjoying Of Christmas Eve, an activity that had the help of dozens of volunteers, among them, a fixture of this already traditional event: the comedian and actor from Malaga Dani Rovira.
In the early afternoon he got behind the bar as one more to distribute the up to 3,000 Christmas menus that the association has achieved thanks to the solidarity of citizens.
Six euros that could be donated so that those who have less could taste half a chicken with garnish * - which were commissioned to 28 steaks - and a potato omelet to accompany.
In addition to his role as an actor, Rovira is recognized for his role as an ambassador to the city and Angeles de la Noche is one of the ten associations he has lent his time to for four years.
It is not the first time that he distributes the Christmas Eve menus in the association and he himself confesses that it has become an extension of the very night he shares with his family.
Part of the fire brigade and the local police also joined this delivery.
A few hours before the night in which they usually enjoy a family evening and in which many decided to give their time so that everyone can feel it as a special day.

In the morning the street smelled of freshly made fritters, a different breakfast that came straight from Antequera.
Neither were the roasted potatoes missing.
With the traditional station of plaque, Ana and Manolo mounted their cart in the middle of the esplanade so that everyone would taste this traditional product.
Even a hairdresser - David - improvised a &quot;hairdresser&quot; and cut the hair to the users of the association while they waited their turn to pick up the menu or they took some of the bags of food that the Malagueños Angels of the Night distributed in the afternoon.
And is that another of the traditions of the day is the great distribution of food that makes the association.
Up to 50,000 kilos of food were delivered to those who need this help to continue forward, a distribution that is done on a monthly basis but at Christmas surpasses the rest of the months and causes each user to take home between 12 and 14 kilos of food, according to the president of the association, Antonio Menéndez.

  Alternatives to flying ??   My Dad wants to come and visit for a few weeks but he wont fly (health and being a stubborn old man) The old sailing passenger liners have gone now and he doesn't want to just stop off for a few days as offered on the ROW cruises. Does anyone know of any other options for him.    Yes. I have an option for him Col.  Freighter passenger.  I'll fiddle about seeing if I can find a linky or two to what I mean.  Let's get your Dad here.    I'm looking for a particular site where enthusiasts talk about this type of travelling but this is a bit of an example. So is this one  Maris    Yes. I have an option for him Col.  Freighter passenger.  Tis the only method I can think of short of thumbing lifts and using several types of animal.  Would be dull at times, but also quite a good experience to hitch a ride on a Frieght ship.  Just me?  Ok....   Whats dull when you are young can be bliss when you are older.   It wouldn't have ready made entertainment and overly fancy frills but would still be a quite enjoyable method of getting from A to B.   I'm surprised at the price to be honest.  I was expecting a voyage to be much less than that.    I'm surprised at the price to be honest.  I was expecting a voyage to be much less than that.  Why?  The time at sea can be extensive and it's not hitching a ride as such. There is still food and board to consider. Look at the days at sea and the daily rate. It may seem more reasonable.  It won't have the fancy frills the the bums on seats cruises have but it will still get a person from A to B    ..... It wouldn't have ready made entertainment.....  I don't know, there might be some excitement if the ship sails through the Suez Canal, as it passes the east coast of Africa.     My Dad wants to come and visit for a few weeks but he wont fly (health and being a stubborn old man) The old sailing passenger liners have gone now and he doesn't want to just stop off for a few days as offered on the ROW cruises. Does anyone know of any other options for him.   The QM2 sails from Southampton eastbound on a world tour beginning January each year. Or he could hop on one cruise ship to another...until he arrives in NZ.   Could do London to Hong Kong by train http://blog.world-first.co.uk/2582/l...-kong-by-train then by sea down to Auckland... is an option....   What about swim and walk???  I'm sure there is some rich I tell you how to live person who's done this  Free of charge and excellent exercise   I believe digging would be the most direct route.    Yes. I have an option for him Col. Freighter passenger.  Only problem is that it isn't cheap, could easily get a business or even first class fare for the same cost. Which may be enough for some people alleviate any health worries.    Why?   I just had a price point in my head and was surprised, that's all.  This is a good point, however;   Only problem is that it isn't cheap, could easily get a business or even first class fare for the same cost. Which may be enough for some people alleviate any health worries.    Just for the 'living person who has done it without flying' thing:  My uncle got from the UK to Australia by hitching a ride by various means and some were animals...!  He loved it. However, for context; he did this in his 20s, probably had a couple of nights sleeping rough as he's not the most organised person in the world and barely had a penny to his name so he had to work his way through on odd jobs etc. Proper 'old school' methods by today's young 'un standards...   There's a lad in the UK that rode an Oz postie motorbike from Oz to UK...good book to read...can't see the title it's on my Kindle that has a flat battery     There's a lad in the UK that rode an Oz postie motorbike from Oz to UK...good book to read...can't see the title it's on my Kindle that has a flat battery   There are some really good books about people doing that kind of trek aren't there, I love them, specially how they cope going across the wilder bits of Asia.

  Brunel Becoming A University Of London ???   Just was thinking about it the other day city university has applied to become part of the university of london union and I think brunel should apply to it is probably the best univesity in london not to be part of the University of london union and theres many advantages of bieng part of this union after all brunel is ranked higher than queen mary in many subject leauge tables and there is not to much difference in entry requiremenrts so i think brunel should apply in the near future so what do you think    views appreciated  constituent colleges of the University of London * Birkbeck, University of London (BBK) * Goldsmiths, University of London (GUL) * King's College London (KCL) * The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE * Queen Mary, University of London (QMUL) * Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL) * School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) * The School of Pharmacy, University of London * University College London (UCL) * St George's, University of London, formerly St George's Hospital Medical School (SGUL)   It probably should as Thames Valley Uni has started calling themselves the 'University of West London'. Brunel should distance itself from former Polly's as Uni's such as UEA and Surrey have better repuations when their histories are very similar to Brunel's.   Hi Kama215 - The University Council agree with you! - Brunel is applying to become part of the University of London and has been planning to for several years, it's not really a straightforward application though, and they have to wait for City to be decided about first. Hopefully we will find out if Brunel are accepted at some point next year.

That they continue to feed their anger, there will be no peace for these traitors when the time is right.
It is more important than stopping them when they are beating someone
The door is not opened and in peace.
Incidentally, in general if the police knock our door without a warrant I think it&#39;s best not to even open them, and to explain what they want through the door.

They come to my house and I send them to ass very fast ass
Orwell&#39;s has long since become a utopia.
This is undoubtedly the worst possible future.
And so ends with Democracy in Europe.
Then they come out talking to the populists and they use techniques of fascist regimes.
Here they will do the same, and look at what it costs them to take all these innocent men for VIOGEN, and tomorrow they would take you to a Gulag if your boss orders it while they charge at the end of the month.
So ale, continue sucking state cock and dick, which here you like.
If I like something of what is going to come is that they will see things without distortions.
And then to say: &quot;do not ejque are the reds&quot;, &quot;as are the progress&quot;, &quot;are the immigrants&quot; ....

Well, thank goodness I do not use Twitter ...

That sounds great on paper, but most people shit in their pants.
I assure you, most will open up as they insist.
Many people who know a lot about laws and such and such, in the end just opening the door, also that they have trade and know how to do things and what to say according to what kind of people.

And the fools of the ass affirming that we live in democracy and freedom.
This is increasingly similar to any criminal regime such as Stalinism or Nazism.
The police go to the houses to think in a democracy.
SEEING IS BELIEVING.
This situation is worse, because it is perverse.
We are supposed to be in a democracy, but in practice it is not such, in a dictatorial regime one is aware of the dictatorship, and one fights to eliminate it and to establish democracy, and you see where, we go to them, but ¿ How many are we who give of it?
And yet we are focused on a transfer of sovereignty to Brussels, which does and undoes at will.

As they have as much success with those visits as they have in the finals of the soccer world of go ass, pringaos
I have deleted twitter, every day can talk about less things, is despicable.
The problem is not that they make that stupid visit, I also would send them to take up ass after laughing in his face.
The problem is that if they are willing to go to your own house for that jerk, it&#39;s because they already have you signed up so that, in case the issue gets out of hand, come and find yourself a &quot;dissident&quot; or &quot;Nazi&quot; along with Many other pringados who made the mistake of writing something on the internet (we could be ourselves), and that to know where they take you or what they do to you.

I do not use Twitter or Facebook, it&#39;s saintly.

That they continue to feed their anger, there will be no peace for these traitors when the time is right.
It is more important than stopping them when they are beating someone
The door is not opened and in peace.
Incidentally, in general if the police knock our door without a warrant I think it&#39;s best not to even open them, and to explain what they want through the door.

They come to my house and I send them to ass very fast ass
Orwell&#39;s has long since become a utopia.
This is undoubtedly the worst possible future.
And so ends with Democracy in Europe.
Then they come out talking to the populists and they use techniques of fascist regimes.
Here they will do the same, and look at what it costs them to take all these innocent men for VIOGEN, and tomorrow they would take you to a Gulag if your boss orders it while they charge at the end of the month.
So ale, continue sucking state cock and dick, which here you like.
If I like something of what is going to come is that they will see things without distortions.
And then to say: &quot;do not ejque are the reds&quot;, &quot;as are the progress&quot;, &quot;are the immigrants&quot; ....

Well, thank goodness I do not use Twitter ...

That sounds great on paper, but most people shit in their pants.
I assure you, most will open up as they insist.
Many people who know a lot about laws and such and such, in the end just opening the door, also that they have trade and know how to do things and what to say according to what kind of people.

And the fools of the ass affirming that we live in democracy and freedom.
This is increasingly similar to any criminal regime such as Stalinism or Nazism.
The police go to the houses to think in a democracy.
SEEING IS BELIEVING.
This situation is worse, because it is perverse.
We are supposed to be in a democracy, but in practice it is not such, in a dictatorial regime one is aware of the dictatorship, and one fights to eliminate it and to establish democracy, and you see where, we go to them, but ¿ How many are we who give of it?
And yet we are focused on a transfer of sovereignty to Brussels, which does and undoes at will.

As they have as much success with those visits as they have in the finals of the soccer world of go ass, pringaos
I have deleted twitter, every day can talk about less things, is despicable.
The problem is not that they make that stupid visit, I also would send them to take up ass after laughing in his face.
The problem is that if they are willing to go to your own house for that jerk, it&#39;s because they already have you signed up so that, in case the issue gets out of hand, come and find yourself a &quot;dissident&quot; or &quot;Nazi&quot; along with Many other pringados who made the mistake of writing something on the internet (we could be ourselves), and that to know where they take you or what they do to you.

I do not use Twitter or Facebook, it&#39;s saintly.

ERROR in getting root of dep graph for sentence.  Sentence is:
[CharacterOffsetBeginAnnotation=207 CharacterOffsetEndAnnotation=334 TokenBeginAnnotation=207 TokenEndAnnotation=334 TextAnnotation=- For those who receive payments, a seller, you can load it from your paypal account and get the money in a cashier, a friend of mine uses it like that, because Hacienda embargo the accounts and can not make moves to their bank accounts
Disadvantages: - It has some type of commission for the operations, but it is not much
I use a prepaid card or wallet as you prefer to call them and it is very good because you are charging the money just for what you want to go shopping, for example to buy cash online is not good and there is a risk that you will then load things on the same card without authorization.

PayPal Card
I have the PayPal card, what are its advantages and disadvantages?
I have looked at threads of the bubble but they are somewhat ancient.
Thank you

My opinion is that whatever is in cash, the better.
I&#39;d rather avoid financing more banks ...
I use a prepaid card or wallet as you prefer to call them and it is very good because you are loading the money just for what you want to go shopping, for example to buy cash online is not good and there is a risk that you will then load things on the same card without authorization.
With this type of cards you pay the right amount and leave it to zero until next time and you can not charge anything or get cash from the cashier if they clone because there simply is no funds beyond what you set.
Very interesting, I put a few cases:
- You can buy online with it, it works as a prepaid-You can buy in stores.
- It can be associated with your paypal account.
- For those who receive payments, a seller, you can load it from your paypal account and get the money in a cashier, a friend of mine uses it like that, because Hacienda embargo the accounts and can not make moves to their bank accounts
Disadvantages: - It has some type of commission for the operations, but it is not much

I agree with you that it is the best option.
It costs 5e although in beruby you are paid 2.5 for making it.
I do not know if you pay for doing it or once a year, then you have more commissions for operations.
The truth about having free debit cards does not make much sense to you ...

The London and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges reach an agreement for their merger
The London Stock Exchange and Germany&#39;s Deutsche Börse have reached a formal agreement for a &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; merger that will create a global group in Europe.
In a statement, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) says its shareholders will receive 45.6% of the shares of the combined group, while investors of its new German partner - which manages, among others, the Frankfurt park - will receive 54.4%.
Therefore, the exchange agreed last month is maintained.
The shares of both companies have welcomed the decision with rises, albeit somewhat lower than when the preliminary merger agreement was announced. &quot;
Following the approval of the supervisory board, the board of directors of Deutsche Börse has today closed an agreement to combine the business with LSE under a British holding company, &quot;the German company said in a statement.
LSE CEO Xavier Rolet also noted that both companies will create a group &quot;leader in infrastructures for global markets&quot;.
The announcement comes as the New York Stock Exchange trader weighed in on a parallel bid for the London park.
The union of the LSE, founded in 1801, and Deutsche Börse, created in 1992, must be approved by the European competition authorities and by the shareholders of both companies.
It should conclude, according to the calculations of the German operator, &quot;at the end of this year or in the first quarter of 2017&quot;.
As agreed in February, the new European stock exchange giant will be controlled by a single governing body that will be composed of the same number of representatives of the German firm (8) and the British firm (8).
Donald Brydon, the current chairman of the LSE, will head the board of directors, while the company&#39;s chief executive will be Carsten Kengeter, now CEO of Deutsche Börse.
The financial director of the group will be David Warren, who now holds the same position in the manager of the London park.
The headquarters will be shared between London and Frankfurt, according to the statement from the German operator.
When will it take to give away BME ??
Because I do not know how they will do with the BREXIT theme maybe there is a BGREXIT?
And that of the competition between stock exchanges, where is it?
There will be no BREXIT, in the Pérfida Albion already know it.
But this threat does them well to get more MONEY.
K rarest thing
Because I do not know how they will do with the BREXIT theme maybe there is a BGREXIT?
Will not fall that breeze!
Of this they have been talking for more than ten years, whatever it is, it is surely bad for us mortals
And here we have Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Bilbao and Valencia
And that of the competition between stock exchanges, where is it?
Compete is poor.
When will it take to give away BME ??
They are already preparing the way.
And here we have Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Bilbao and Valencia
The madrid bag is a churro in the global world
She could buy the Mogadishu bag if she wanted
I find it hard to believe.
It seems to me impossible.
It is rare that a stock market belongs to several independent states, where is the headquarters?

By the way to the English forera you have to have given a heart attack to see that part of the city has been sold
I think that in this thread there are many people who do not know what the operators are that manage the stock market (companies that usually have a little value within the main index), and what are the stock exchanges of its main companies, which in this case Are the DAX and FTSE100, which obviously do not merge.

Already UK is in the hands of the EU.

An economist told me that in the case of Brexit it would be obligatory to have a EUR / GBP parity and then EUR / GBP / USD parity and hence a step towards the virtual single currency.
Even with these three existing coins anchored to each other.

Forgotten Corruption
Does anyone wonder that everyone tries to take advantage of their political position?
Twenty years ago corruption was on the agenda and nothing happened.
10 years ago, corruption was greater and still less spent.
A crisis has had to come so that the steal that our political leaders have submitted to us will begin to emerge.
To the greater indignation of the populace, here I put one of the cases that remained in nothing.
All defendants acquitted in &#39;Ollero case&#39; after 14 years and two trials
The indictment of commissions for the Pedrizas-Salinas motorway involved in 1992 a former director general of the Board The first sentence was based on wiretaps declared illegal after
The scandal of the alleged collection of commissions for the construction of the Las Pedrizas-Salinas dual carriageway has finally come to nothing after 14 years.
The First Section of the Provincial Court of Seville has acquitted the four accused of the so-called &#39;Ollero case&#39; for the alleged payment of commissions in the adjudication of the works for the unfolding of the road linking the port of Las Pedrizas with Salinas, Between Malaga and Granada.
The sentence is based on the previous annulment, by unconstitutional, of the tapped telephone tapes to the imputed ones and, therefore, absolves to Manuel Ollero, ex- director general of Roads of the Meeting of Andalusia; Jorge Ollero&#39;s brother, and two former directors of the construction company Ocisa - to which the work was awarded -, JRB and LNM, accused of paying the commissions.
The sentence, however, reflects a reflection of the magistrates recognizing that some aspects &quot;miss and squeak for the average citizen.&quot;
The Ollero case trial, which dates back to 1992, has been repeated because the Constitutional Court overturned the telephone &quot;punctures&quot; on which the first conviction of the four defendants, issued in 1999, was based.
In 2001, the Supreme Court confirmed the opinion of the Audiencia of Seville for the case, which condemned Manuel Ollero to one year of incapacitation to hold public office and his brother Jorge Ollero to three months of increased arrest for influence peddling.
However, two years later the Constitutional Court declared null and void.
In the new sentence, the judges say that &quot;all the evidence of charge was based on telephone tapping, which has been declared illegal&quot; and the summary statements of the accused, who were not corroborated in the trial since they took their right Not to declare.
The judges add that the &quot;millionaire&quot; movements in Ocisa&#39;s cash boxes are not sufficient proof either, although they recognize that &quot;it is strange and annoying to the average citizen that a company with Ocisa&#39;s turnover should have these boxes for ordinary payments&quot; .
Wickets
Although the prosecutor asked for sentences of between three months &#39;imprisonment and 28 months&#39; imprisonment, the judges say that the &quot;proof tables&quot; they have do not show that &quot;Manuel Ollero offered privileged information to his brother, that this information was transmitted to Pedro Llach &quot;, An intermediary who died in 1998, and who in turn sent it to the directors of OCISA.
There is also no evidence that JRB, former president of OCISA, awarded Llach 28 million pesetas, of which 22 million were intervened by police to Jorge Ollero in the early hours of July 15, 1992, when he returned from Madrid to Seville for highway.
An appeal may be brought against the judgment.
By the way does anyone know who is the president of the builder resulting from OCISA?

ERROR in getting root of dep graph for sentence.  Sentence is:
[CharacterOffsetBeginAnnotation=116 CharacterOffsetEndAnnotation=220 TokenBeginAnnotation=116 TokenEndAnnotation=220 TextAnnotation=Part of this is because of the possibility of harassment if I get stopped while traveling across state lines with a firearm, the less chance of drawing attention to myself when I am out there, etc. Basically I have moved most of my firearms to Northern Wisconsin, and I am going predominately AirGuns in CA.  While searching the internet I also fell in love with the new big bore.357 Crossman BullDog, yes it's pretty expensive for an AirGun, but I wanted to be one of the first few kids on the block to have one, lol.

  No Airguns shipped to CA as of Jan. 1st   I am posting the CA section even though this should go more in the firearms/weapons section because I just want to vent to other people living in CA, or like me, seasonally. I really don't want the CA bashing trolls like so many other threads regarding CA law bring out. Hopefully, non CA people can have the same respect as they do for the Australian/NZ or South Africa thread.  So I have been working with another SB member on getting a new Air Gun for small game hunting when I am out on my claim. Part of this is because of the possibility of harassment if I get stopped while traveling across state lines with a firearm, the less chance of drawing attention to myself when I am out there, etc. Basically I have moved most of my firearms to Northern Wisconsin, and I am going predominately AirGuns in CA.  While searching the internet I also fell in love with the new big bore.357 Crossman BullDog, yes it's pretty expensive for an AirGun, but I wanted to be one of the first few kids on the block to have one, lol. Shoots up to a 135 grain bullet at 700 fps, but I am sidetracking.  So anyways I went to place one of my orders through Sportsmansguide and had a major letdown. Apparently as of the 1st of the year Air Guns cannot be shipped to CA. Even if they could the new law also bars even the Pellets from being shipped. I guess you can't even buy BB's online any more.  I remember the new law being passed after that kid with a so called look-a-like AK-47, even though it had an orange tip, was shot by police up in Santa Rosa, but I just didn't realize what kind of ripple effect it would have.  Both AirGuns I was looking at are uncommon, so it's not like I can find them at Big 5 or Richard's (I would use their real name but it get's censored). Besides I was hoping to use a special double discount (20%) for Sportsmansguide Memebers.  Anyways, just wanted to let you all know and how even AirGuns are being restricted now. I was going to vent, but I had gotten all excited about my new toy and now just am bummed out.  I guess I need to check if it restricts me from bringing it with me next fall and I'll buy it when I am in Wis.   I really feel for the people of CA. No matter which way they turn, they are pretty much screwed when it comes to guns. Good thing you have yours here in WI.   The problem is NOT with Calif., but Sportsmans Guide. Apparently, for unknown reasons, they will not ship them to Calif. This is a 2011 article I found about this matter. Next time, don't give up so easy.  http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/s...d.php?t=428092   My daughter does have a few I gave her and transferred to her name. Yes, starting last year even long guns have to be registered by new owners.    The problem is NOT with Calif., but Sportsmans Guide. Apparently, for unknown reasons, they will not ship them to Calif. This is a 2011 article I found about this matter. Next time, don't give up so easy.  http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/s...d.php?t=428092  That info is dated 2011, the new law went into effect 10 days ago. I didn't give up easy, unless searching online for an hour and reading the new statute is considered giving up easy. Next time, you should research more and not use 4 year old info when jumping on me.  At that time, yes, but I researched further and found that the new law (AB 199) would have restricted it any ways. I tried putting my order in through Crossman for the other one as well, but it came back that they are are currently unavailable for shipping to CA. Maybe they are waiting to paint them a bright color like pink, which totally ruins both guns.  Yes, I am thinking of ordering it through Big 5 or Richard's but then it's going to cost me $200 more. You are right though, in that I need to go to Big 5 tomorrow and see how this is affecting the Air guns sold here in the state.  http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/...ffect-in-2016/

Adsense there are no advertisers?
I do not stop seeing that much of adsense ads are from Google itself.
You are promoting adwords bag on youtube ... or gmail for companies.
A country that has hundreds of thousands of companies and adsense or appear.

When adsense put ads of whores, florecera, in this country whores and waiters, but these Americans do not even understand the national economic model
The rest of the countries work differently, especially the Anglo-Saxon market
Adsense is rubbish, it was only a matter of time to go off atpc

Not only that.
For 2 months I am selling a unique product and differentiator at a fair price and 95% I sell it outside: canada, usa, uk, germany, even ballistic countries.
This is a country of GITANOS where we want everything gift or pirated.

No wonder, shur, this country has a clear economic model, whores and waiters, with all respect for both groups, but it is a real disaster that there is nothing outside these two sectors, the rest dying, sexual services and Binge for guiris
Whore via tete
Pd: both professions are necessary, but do not jodais, a country whose economic engine is tourism, without industry, reduced in quotas of agriculture and fisheries by the EEC, let&#39;s fuck ruin

Well if fire, but people do not want to find out about the movie, this is a third world country mentally.

Adsense there are no advertisers?
I do not stop seeing that much of adsense ads are from Google itself.
You are promoting adwords bag on youtube ... or gmail for companies.
A country that has hundreds of thousands of companies and adsense or appear.

When adsense put ads of whores, florecera, in this country whores and waiters, but these Americans do not even understand the national economic model
The rest of the countries work differently, especially the Anglo-Saxon market
Adsense is rubbish, it was only a matter of time to go off atpc

Not only that.
For 2 months I am selling a unique product and differentiator at a fair price and 95% I sell it outside: canada, usa, uk, germany, even ballistic countries.
This is a country of GITANOS where we want everything gift or pirated.

No wonder, shur, this country has a clear economic model, whores and waiters, with all respect for both groups, but it is a real disaster that there is nothing outside these two sectors, the rest dying, sexual services and Binge for guiris
Whore via tete
Pd: both professions are necessary, but do not jodais, a country whose economic engine is tourism, without industry, reduced in quotas of agriculture and fisheries by the EEC, let&#39;s fuck ruin

Well if fire, but people do not want to find out about the movie, this is a third world country mentally.

  If UK leaves EU?   There was a thread that touched on this a while back, but since the vote is very close, I thought I'd be interested to know what thoughts you have.  In particular, I wonder how a 'leave' vote would affect British citizens like me who plan to move to France within next few years or so. Will it still be possible? So much harder? What would we lose vs EU membership now?  Oh, and if anyone uses that God-awful, slick, trivializing and daft word Brexit, could the mods please ban them immediately.  Edit: I see this has been pretty well covered on a 'sister' site. Still, a bit worrying to think I've been sending my life savings for years into a French bank account in a country I might soon have no firm legal right to live in when the time comes.   If it is true that if the UK leaves the EU it will re-join EFTA then there will surely be no real change, as EFTA requires free movement of people.  If that is not the case, your position would be much the same as anyone else wanting to move to France from outside of the EU. So look at the rules that would currently apply to a person from [pick a non-EU country].

The straight answer is that nobody knows what will happen if the UK votes to leave the EU. However, as far as residency is concerned then the UK and France would have to come to an agreement because of the 500,000 french citizens living in the UK and the large numbers of UK citizens living or owning property in France. As you are aware, this would not be a one-way problem. UK citizens lived in France before the EU and they will continue after the EU. Exactly how? I have no idea. Lets wait and see.

So look at the rules that would currently apply to a person from [pick a non-EU country]. It might appeal to their Gallic humour for all Brits in France to become refugees but, as Cyrian says, there are more French living in the UK than Brits in France, although the proportion of retirees is probably quite different.

  What is wrong with FedEx?   OK I just need to vent for a second. I know this has all been hashed out before in these forums, I guess I just hope at some point someone at FedEx or apple come across one of these and decide to do something about it.  So last week I ordered: iBook, iPod, printer, Office, a mouse, and an adapter kit. I asked for the 2-3 day international shipping, you know cause it was $30 and I thought what trhe heck, be nice if this stuff got here sooner. So here it is monday and so far I have reiceved the ipod, office, and the printer, which is what? almost $600 worth of stuff, all of which has been left on the front porch there for all of our hooligan nighbor kids to pick and choose from and the rain to rain on and the sun to heat up to who know how hot. FedEx claims that someone signed a waiver for them to just drop it off sans signature, I didn't sign a waiver, if apple did I would be suprised considering the other posts on here about how rabid they are about signatures, but who knows. Today I checked the status of the iBook, you know I'd like to be around when that one shows up just in case the FedEx truck slows down before they throw it on my porch. Here is what thier tracking page shows me:  Aug 6, 2005 3:37 AM Arrived at FedEx location MEMPHIS, TN  Aug 5, 2005 5:40 PM Arrived at FedEx location ANCHORAGE, AK  5:40 PM Departed FedEx location ANCHORAGE, AK  Aug 6, 2005 12:21 AM Shipment exception SHANGHAI CN Delay beyond our control  Aug 5, 2005 10:45 PM Picked up SHANGHAI CN  Package received after FedEx cutoff  Aug 4, 2005 11:30 PM At local FedEx facility SHANGHAI CN  And it says it won't be delivered until august 10th at 8pm! No matter what kind of fancy math they are using that ain't 2-3 days. Thats at least 4 and if you compensate for time zones its more like 2+3 days. Not to mention it's been sitting in their Memphis warehouse since friday morning. I just don't get it. I don't want to get it, I just want the stuff I ordered on the day I paid to get it here, not left in the weather and free for anyone to snag off the porch. Is that really to much to ask from a shipping company? Certainly if it not here in the next 24 hours I am going to be asking apple to refund that $30, also to maybe think about using a different shipper.  Ok I feel better now. Not really, but I will feel better when the stuff I have been charged 2g for is out of the hands of whoever is running the show over at FedEx/Kinkos.

  AQA GCsE conlict poems   I'm in year 10 and I would like to ask if someone would be kind enough to tell me poems that could be compared together in the conflict section of the AQA anthology, moon on the tides. Thank you.   Mametz Wood and next to of course god america i  Posted from TSR Mobile   Belfast Confetti with everything (confusion) Mametz Wood and Out of the Blue ( I know odd, but they're both 'floaty') Out of the Blue and Futility, this is what I did in the exam (again, odd, but they both look at death in different ways) Hawk Roosting with Futility, Mametz Wood and Come on Come Back {a poem that I loathe} (all have references to nature)  Just a few suggestions  You can get a revision guide 'AQA GCSE Poetry Conflict' and it tells you what you can compare the poem to at the bottom of the page.   Out of the blue and bayonet charge both look at an individual's experience in conflict, so are good to compare. Come on come back and Belfast confetti both show confusion   Thank you, all these replies have been helpful.

REAL NEP: The Spaniards are crazy.
This is NEP.
No decent jobs, no benefits, no services ....
People leave Paraiso Mariano.
The emigration of Spaniards beats the record since the beginning of the crisis | Contact Us | The pa
They are emperors neperianas ...
And they go to the neoliberal Merkelian Germany or to the terrible British City, never to Venezuela or model countries of the style for people like the author of the thread.
Paper bin.
A few years ago, the president of this Principality, Vicente Alvarez Areces (AKA &quot;Tinín&quot;, AKA &quot;gochu fartón&quot;) referred to the young people who left Asturias to go to Madrid or abroad in search of work as &quot;Urban legends&quot; ... according to the neperians the Spaniards who are emigrating now are also urban legends, after all who in their right mind would want to leave the locomotive in Europe?
Most of Spain is going to be made a lot, they will be rid the most industrialized cities and the most tourist.
Not only because of the emigration, but because of the deaths, there are a lot of older people about to beat it.
And those who say that immigrants will cover it makes me very funny, once in Spain they can go to France, Germany ... and a lot of better countries, here they will not stay when they have much better opportunities in The rest of europe.

The journalist&#39;s lack of empathy is brutal, his only concern is that Spain loses prominence on the European map, that the young people are dying of disgust or exploited, or with an inaccessible home ... that does not seem to matter too much.
It&#39;s a good thing I stop reading ahce time propaganda

Denying Evidence Permanently.
Taking into account that we speak of Spaniards, they usually migrate to developed countries.
Although there are many already by Brazil, China etc ..
But how I want to laugh a little .... Ecuador.
President Correa lol
28,750 Ecuadorians left Spain in 2013 to return to the country, according to statistics-Ecuador-News | The universe
Spain goes to PPeor with the mentally retarded mariasno.
I hopefully in 3 months I get pissed off, I do not want to be in a country where I have been ambitious or reC (s).
I also get pissed, specifically in an hour and until Wednesday.
We must give impetus to the NEP.
First of all the link does not work because I am missing the full details of the news.
Second and is a widely discussed topic, many of &quot;Spanish&quot; are nationalized immigrants.

There are many Spanish engineers in Ecuador, I personally know several.
Statistically they are a drop in the ocean compared to the nationalized Ecuadorians returning to their country, but there are them.
Better not get the actual figures, I know a lot of people outside the country without being discharged.
We are a lot off, and every day I see more and more people emigrating
Who are they?
Well many young people who have been ready, taking advantage of Erasmus, have learned English and have studies.
They get to enter some currito, of practices.
Some already come with good performance even
Others start from scratch, like those who go to London to see them coming, or from Au-pair to some remote country in Europe.
And some find better conditions after learning the language.
The adventure of living outside your home.
Because they kicked us out of it
Against this mastodon can not be fought; Everything is well tied ... And looking at the polls, those of us outside cry when we see how those two parties, or 1 (PPSOE), still govern ... with all those plots, those moves, these accusations and corruption.
People are still voting for them
Until in about 30 years there will be no change in politics as such.
If we arrive
There are many Spanish engineers in Ecuador, I personally know several.

  Apple Begins Hiring for First Belgian Retail Store in Brussels   After years of speculation, Apple may be preparing to open its first retail store in Belgium in the city of Brussels, reports Belgian blog Apple Nieuws Vlaanderen. Apple yesterday posted six job listings for vacant positions in the upcoming Brussels location.   Details on the store and its location were not provided in the listing, but the store is believed to be planned on the Guldenvlieslaan in a new complex which is currently under construction. The building is expected to be completed in 2015, with Apple as a possible launch retailer. Future Belgian Apple stores are expected for Ghent and Antwerp following the Brussels opening.  Apple is continuing to expand its retail operations under the leadership of Angela Ahrendts, opening stores both domestically and internationally. The company opened its first stores in Turkey earlier this year and has also been hiring for stores in the United Arab Emirates  Article Link: Apple Begins Hiring for First Belgian Retail Store in Brussels   Surely a plot to infiltrate the core of the EU.   Glassed Silver:mac   Awesome! I hope that they have a beer corner too    Greek store ρε μουνιά!   Easy-M has been the Apple retailer since 1984 with stores that follow the Apple store design philosophy. Heck, in the beginning I thought that Easy-M stores were the official Apple stores for Belgium.  I suspect that the Apple Stores will meet their selling targets because they are the official stores, but if they don't offer something extra compared to the Apple Stores in other European countries,they will not become the market leader (for their own product) in Belgium.   Err? Huh? It's an Apple owned and operated store. What leads you to believe Apple would open a store, first in a country, and not commit to it as it does other stores? Such a general statement you could make it about any company, just don't get revelance.    Err? Huh? It's an Apple owned and operated store. What leads you to believe Apple would open a store, first in a country, and not commit to it as it does other stores? Such a general statement you could make it about any company, just don't get revelance.   What I wanted to say is that Apple is late to the party in Belgium where one company over a period of 30 years has 20 stores fully tailored to Apple products in similar looking stores as the Apple stores worldwide. They also give discounts to loyal customers and there are only 11 million Belgians, which will make it tough on the new Apple store to really compete here.   That same situation did not save myriad other competitors in other countries. Apple stores will get all the new products first. Resellers will have to wait. Good luck with that loyalty scheme.   Finally! I'm not fan of the current franchises in Belgium. Service depends on the mood and knowledge of the personnel and it varies greatly.  I have had two bad experiences with these franchises. I shop online or drive to Amsterdam or Paris for now    Finally! I'm not fan of the current franchises in Belgium. Service depends on the mood and knowledge of the personnel and it varies greatly.   I had a similar experience in the Amsterdam Apple Store, but okay.   An Apple Store in Belgium, you say? In the city of Brussels? I guess you could say it is... Sprouting up! YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   yes! Don't know if Lab9 en Switch are going to hold up.    Finally! I'm not fan of the current franchises in Belgium. Service depends on the mood and knowledge of the personnel and it varies greatly.  I have had two bad experiences with these franchises. I shop online or drive to Amsterdam or Paris for now   Yup - I shop online or wait until I travel to the UK myself...it'll be good to finally have an actual Apple Store in Brussels, and I have zero sympathies for the franchises who have caused me more than enough issues in the past ( exceptionally long warranty repair time, very high charges to diagnose an issue with a laptop that was then too expensive to justify repairing, flat out lying about not accepting pre-orders on an iPhone, and when I turned up on the day to buy one, they stated they had all been sold in pre-order, as well as small stuff like staff spending time chatting amongst themselves or to friends when there are customers waiting, etc).  -- Pete.

  Apple Begins Hiring for First Belgian Retail Store in Brussels   After years of speculation, Apple may be preparing to open its first retail store in Belgium in the city of Brussels, reports Belgian blog Apple Nieuws Vlaanderen. Apple yesterday posted six job listings for vacant positions in the upcoming Brussels location.   Details on the store and its location were not provided in the listing, but the store is believed to be planned on the Guldenvlieslaan in a new complex which is currently under construction. The building is expected to be completed in 2015, with Apple as a possible launch retailer. Future Belgian Apple stores are expected for Ghent and Antwerp following the Brussels opening.  Apple is continuing to expand its retail operations under the leadership of Angela Ahrendts, opening stores both domestically and internationally. The company opened its first stores in Turkey earlier this year and has also been hiring for stores in the United Arab Emirates  Article Link: Apple Begins Hiring for First Belgian Retail Store in Brussels   Surely a plot to infiltrate the core of the EU.   Glassed Silver:mac   Awesome! I hope that they have a beer corner too    Greek store ρε μουνιά!   Easy-M has been the Apple retailer since 1984 with stores that follow the Apple store design philosophy. Heck, in the beginning I thought that Easy-M stores were the official Apple stores for Belgium.  I suspect that the Apple Stores will meet their selling targets because they are the official stores, but if they don't offer something extra compared to the Apple Stores in other European countries,they will not become the market leader (for their own product) in Belgium.   Err? Huh? It's an Apple owned and operated store. What leads you to believe Apple would open a store, first in a country, and not commit to it as it does other stores? Such a general statement you could make it about any company, just don't get revelance.    Err? Huh? It's an Apple owned and operated store. What leads you to believe Apple would open a store, first in a country, and not commit to it as it does other stores? Such a general statement you could make it about any company, just don't get revelance.   What I wanted to say is that Apple is late to the party in Belgium where one company over a period of 30 years has 20 stores fully tailored to Apple products in similar looking stores as the Apple stores worldwide. They also give discounts to loyal customers and there are only 11 million Belgians, which will make it tough on the new Apple store to really compete here.   That same situation did not save myriad other competitors in other countries. Apple stores will get all the new products first. Resellers will have to wait. Good luck with that loyalty scheme.   Finally! I'm not fan of the current franchises in Belgium. Service depends on the mood and knowledge of the personnel and it varies greatly.  I have had two bad experiences with these franchises. I shop online or drive to Amsterdam or Paris for now    Finally! I'm not fan of the current franchises in Belgium. Service depends on the mood and knowledge of the personnel and it varies greatly.   I had a similar experience in the Amsterdam Apple Store, but okay.   An Apple Store in Belgium, you say? In the city of Brussels? I guess you could say it is... Sprouting up! YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   yes! Don't know if Lab9 en Switch are going to hold up.    Finally! I'm not fan of the current franchises in Belgium.

I shop online or drive to Amsterdam or Paris for now   Yup - I shop online or wait until I travel to the UK myself...it'll be good to finally have an actual Apple Store in Brussels, and I have zero sympathies for the franchises who have caused me more than enough issues in the past ( exceptionally long warranty repair time, very high charges to diagnose an issue with a laptop that was then too expensive to justify repairing, flat out lying about not accepting pre-orders on an iPhone, and when I turned up on the day to buy one, they stated they had all been sold in pre-order, as well as small stuff like staff spending time chatting amongst themselves or to friends when there are customers waiting, etc).  -- Pete.

Since it is fashionable South Africa lately by the death of Mandela, I leave a video that I passed recently, about Boer nostalgic of the old regime.

Effort, ingenuity and hard work, that&#39;s how nations are built.
The Boers are workers, they carry in their blood the culture of struggle and survival and they came to raise a great country.
Amen.
This one did not die of old like Mandela, but killed: &quot;
In South Africa you can only be one of two things: either you are blind, or you are a racist. &quot;
A good documentary.
Honestly you just have to check how the country was before and how it is now
South Africa could have evolved into something else.
Without apartheid.
But it has gone from that to pretending to be the &quot;bright black pearl of Africa&quot; ​​hope for the rest of the continent.
The result is this:
Malema-type men do not like black fraternity or share the riches of South Africa.
I am imagining many immigrant blacks today who already wanted for themselves the treatment that had many of the blacks who later entered the ANC in the 70s.
Yet we have all seen Afrikaneers in all the paraphernalia these days for Mandela&#39;s death.

Esque is not a black against white.
There are civilized blacks who live with the whites in total normality ... and then there is an infected rabble that kills everything, whites, other blacks, and whoever gets in the way.
It&#39;s as if you get into a neighborhood of shit and start to get gypsies, yonkis, navajeros and all kinds of rabble.
For a Negro they all look like Spaniards, but they are the scum.
The problem in South Africa is that slag is 50% of people.
Until they are civilized ...
The fucking Louis Theroux bent on why a black man can not be boer just for not being white why was not he the one that the fucking one interviewed San Mandela to ask him why a white can not be Xhosa just for being white?
The usual, if a target is racism, if a black is cultural pride, identity, enrichment and blablabla.

We all know that &quot;antiracist&quot; is a codeword for anti-whites.
I would like to learn more about south africa somewhere in English or Spanish?

Go to Johannesburg for a few days.
That&#39;s if you pick a gun over there and do not just go anywhere.

Since it is fashionable South Africa lately by the death of Mandela, I leave a video that I passed recently, about Boer nostalgic of the old regime.

Effort, ingenuity and hard work, that&#39;s how nations are built.
The Boers are workers, they carry in their blood the culture of struggle and survival and they came to raise a great country.
Amen.
This one did not die of old like Mandela, but killed: &quot;
In South Africa you can only be one of two things: either you are blind, or you are a racist. &quot;
A good documentary.
Honestly you just have to check how the country was before and how it is now
South Africa could have evolved into something else.
Without apartheid.
But it has gone from that to pretending to be the &quot;bright black pearl of Africa&quot; ​​hope for the rest of the continent.
The result is this:
Malema-type men do not like black fraternity or share the riches of South Africa.
I am imagining many immigrant blacks today who already wanted for themselves the treatment that had many of the blacks who later entered the ANC in the 70s.
Yet we have all seen Afrikaneers in all the paraphernalia these days for Mandela&#39;s death.
Yet we have all seen Afrikaneers in all the paraphernalia these days for Mandela&#39;s death.
Esque is not a black against white.
There are civilized blacks who live with the whites in total normality ... and then there is an infected rabble that kills everything, whites, other blacks, and whoever gets in the way.
It&#39;s as if you get into a neighborhood of shit and start to get gypsies, yonkis, navajeros and all kinds of rabble.
For a Negro they all look like Spaniards, but they are the scum.
The problem in South Africa is that slag is 50% of people.
Until they are civilized ...
The fucking Louis Theroux bent on why a black man can not be boer just for not being white why was not he the one that the fucking one interviewed San Mandela to ask him why a white can not be Xhosa just for being white?
The usual, if a target is racism, if a black is cultural pride, identity, enrichment and blablabla.

We all know that &quot;antiracist&quot; is a codeword for anti-whites.
I would like to learn more about south africa somewhere in English or Spanish?

Go to Johannesburg for a few days.
That&#39;s if you pick a gun over there and do not just go anywhere.

Defend: clones self  Attack:    Defend: rushes quickly to the first portapotty where desertflower dedatonates the nuclear arsenal.  Attack: puts poster in the same room with bush,free willy and yoda and locks the door.  eugenius: suicide is illegal    Defend: Jumps out of window  Attack: pushes next poster off a cliff   Defend: Yoda can fly.  Attack: Yoda builds a house on the next poster's face.

So far, the script of &#39;Ukip: the first hundred days&#39;, the British Channel 4 docudrama that has recreated what awaits the country if the UK Independence Party seize power and its leader, Eurosceptic Nigel Farage, became the tenant of Downing Street No. 10: &quot;You have not seen anything yet.&quot;
The docudrama interweaves real images with scenes shot with actors, like the popular Priyanga Burdford, in the skin of the hypothetical first deputy of Asian origin of the Ukip.

If Eurosceptics governed in the United Kingdom ... | Contact Us | THE WORLD
Britain has left the European Union and the economy is faltering.
The first factories are closing in the face of falling exports.
In the street, while, the chaos and social protest erupts against the furious anti-immigration measures and the &#39;closure&#39; on the borders.
As a counterpoint, however, smoking is resumed in pubs ...
So far, the script of &#39;Ukip: the first hundred days&#39;, the British Channel 4 docudrama that has recreated what awaits the country if the UK Independence Party seize power and its leader, Eurosceptic Nigel Farage, became the tenant of Downing Street No. 10: &quot;You have not seen anything yet.&quot;
The docudrama interweaves real images with scenes shot with actors, like the popular Priyanga Burdford, in the skin of the hypothetical first deputy of Asian origin of the Ukip.
The show was watched by a million viewers on Monday and prompted a barrage of protests against Ofcom, the communications regulator, as a deliberate intrusion into the May 7 election campaign. &quot;
It seems that the broadcast of &#39;Ukip: the first hundred days&#39; has had a boomerang effect on Channel 4, &quot;wrote on Twitter Farage himself.
This is a biased portrait of the only party that believes in Britain. &quot;
Against the electoral rules?
Ukip member Gerald Batten has asked Ofcom to open an investigation on the grounds that docudrama has flagrantly violated electoral rules: &quot;It is one thing to contribute to the political debate and another thing is this program, which I would describe as a piece of the Corrosive and vile campaign launched by our political rivals. &quot;
Channel 4 has publicly defended the program&#39;s broadcast as &quot;it incites debate and involves viewers on political issues.&quot;
In a brief statement, the television network says that Nigel Farage was given the option to see the docudrama in the first place and to be able to defend his electoral agenda in an interview, to which he resigned.
The television network says its intention has been to analyze &quot;the impact on British society of the flashing rise of Ukip&quot; and that in no case has tried to make the game to the two major parties.
The program has served to bring Ukip back to the fore, to be consumed in the &#39;polling survey&#39; as the third largest political party in Britain, with 15% of voting preferences, compared to 33% Labor Party of Ed Miliband and 32% of the Conservative Party of David Cameron.
Nick Clegg&#39;s Liberal Democrat Party, which is part of the current coalition government, is relegated to fourth place with 7%, tied with Natalie Bennett&#39;s Green Party.
National polls do not however reflect the rise of Nicola Sturgeon&#39;s Scottish National Party (SNP), which can sweep Scotland&#39;s political map of its rivals and hold the key to Downing Street with more than 30 deputies following the 7-M .
That they said they were going to expel the Jews from the city or something?
In the street, while, the chaos and social protest erupts against the furious anti-immigration measures and the &#39;closure&#39; on the borders.
Surely the population would protest a lot against the closure of borders, yes, specifically burning cars and destroying the streets as in London in 2011, or in France every two by three.
Great Nigel Farage.
See if he can give the definitive property to the Supreme Soviet of Brussels.
That ass ...
We can not even imagine the piece of business that the EU supposes for some that in any country is attacked by civil or criminal who is against.
Be left, right, extreme or medium.
To the hunt of who tries to disassemble the shed.
By the way, what factories are going to close in the UK, to wash black money?
Because many more do not have ...
London is the capital of the NWO (one of them), manages the threads of speculation and unproductivity worldwide, is enriched by inflating things, is the capital of Zionism, someone believes that it will stop being so, so why?

President of Somalia appoints economist as new prime minister
MOGADISCIO, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) - Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud named Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed as the country&#39;s new prime minister for the Horn of Africa after several weeks of ousting Abdi Farah Shirdon.
The appointment of the new prime minister comes after weeks of disputes that ended with the vote of Somali lawmakers on a motion of censure that led to the dismissal of Shirdon for &quot;incompetence.&quot;
The outgoing prime minister held the post for 15 months but his differences with the president over the reorganization of the cabinet led to a vote of distrust in Parliament after Prime Minister Shirdon rejected President Hassan&#39;s demand to resign.
Ahmed, 54, studied economics in Canada and lived there for several years before moving to Saudi Arabia to work with the Islamic Development Bank in Jeddah.
The newly appointed prime minister is expected to name his cabinet preserving the balance of power between various clans and communities in Somalia.
The new government will seek the vote of confidence of the 275 members of Somalia&#39;s parliament in the coming weeks.

  Newbie here!   Hi all,  Just joined as I am about to move from the UK to the Netherlands so thought this would be a great place to gain knowledge and meet likeminded people! I'm excited and nervous about the move but life is about adventure so had to take the opportunity when it came my way! I am moving with my wife and 1 yr old daughter    Hi all,  Just joined as I am about to move from the UK to the Netherlands so thought this would be a great place to gain knowledge and meet likeminded people! I'm excited and nervous about the move but life is about adventure so had to take the opportunity when it came my way! I am moving with my wife and 1 yr old daughter  As with everywhere, there are things you will like and also dislike in the Netherlands.I lived there with my familyfor3 years and was sad to leave, as we were transferred.The really great thing that sticks in my mind (apart from the wonderful pancakes on wet winters day) is that things actually work as tney should do.Just follow the rules and customs and I think you'll get along fine. At least make an effort to learn their language, it will be much appreciated, even if they do insist ( out of politeness) in replying in English. Good luck!    Hi all,  Just joined as I am about to move from the UK to the Netherlands so thought this would be a great place to gain knowledge and meet likeminded people! I'm excited and nervous about the move but life is about adventure so had to take the opportunity when it came my way! I am moving with my wife and 1 yr old daughter  Welcome to BE.   I have very fond memories of my time in Holland. I hope you and your family enjoy it as much as we did.   Another welcoming wave to the BE forums.  I love the Netherlands. Unfortunately, have only visited a few times but each time I look forward to going again.   Hi all,  Thank you for your warm welcomes. I'm really looking forward to the move, my wife is more apprehensive but I am sure she will love it. We plan on learning the language, we are not sure how our daughter will fair when she starts talking g though as we already have two languages at home! English and Bulgarian    Hi all,  Thank you for your warm welcomes. I'm really looking forward to the move, my wife is more apprehensive but I am sure she will love it. We plan on learning the language, we are not sure how our daughter will fair when she starts talking g though as we already have two languages at home! English and Bulgarian  Dont worry, children have no problems speaking various languages at the same time; I wish I had had the opportunity when I was very young, as kids brains are like sponges, that just soak up everything. I'm sure you will find you've made a good decision. Get yourselves bikes, leave the car at home, and enjoy the life there!

[CharacterOffsetBeginAnnotation=100 CharacterOffsetEndAnnotation=222 TokenBeginAnnotation=100 TokenEndAnnotation=222 TextAnnotation=Marc Frons, chief information officer for The New York Times Co., issued a statement at 4:20 p.m. warning employees that the disruption - which appeared to still be affecting the website well into the evening - was “the result of a malicious external attack.” He advised employees to “be careful when sending email communications until this situation is resolved.”   In an interview, Frons said the attack was carried out by a group known as “the Syrian Electronic Army, or someone trying very hard to be them.”   The website first went down after 3 p.m.; once service was restored, the hackers quickly disrupted the site again.

  TIMES SITE AFFECTED BY HACKING ATTACK    EDS: UPDATES with second attack and that disruption continued into evening. ADDS Perlroth to byline.) ; (This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.);   NEW YORK - The New York Times website was unavailable to readers on Tuesday afternoon after an online attack on the company’s domain name registrar, Melbourne IT. The attack also forced employees of The Times to take care in sending emails.   Marc Frons, chief information officer for The New York Times Co., issued a statement at 4:20 p.m. warning employees that the disruption - which appeared to still be affecting the website well into the evening - was “the result of a malicious external attack.” He advised employees to “be careful when sending email communications until this situation is resolved.”   In an interview, Frons said the attack was carried out by a group known as “the Syrian Electronic Army, or someone trying very hard to be them.”   The website first went down after 3 p.m.; once service was restored, the hackers quickly disrupted the site again. Shortly after 6 p.m., Frons said that “we believe that we are on the road to fixing the problem.”   The Syrian Electronic Army is made up of hackers who support President Bashar Assad of Syria. Matt Johansen, head of the Threat Research Center at White Hat Security, posted on Twitter that he was directed to a Syrian Web domain when he tried to access The Times’ website.   Until now, The Times has been spared from being hacked by the SEA, which has successfully disrupted the Web operations of news organizations including The Financial Times.   In a post on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, the SEA also said it had hacked the administrative contact information for Twitter’s domain name registry records. According to the Whois.com lookup service, the Syrian Electronic Army was listed on the entries for Twitter’s administrative name, technical name and email address.   Frons said the attacks Tuesday required significantly more skill than the string of SEA attacks on media outlets earlier this year, when the group attacked Twitter accounts for outlets ranging from The Guardian to The Associated Press. Those attacks caused the stock market to plunge after the group planted false tales of explosions at the White House.   “In terms of the sophistication of the attack, this is a big deal,” said Frons. “It’s sort of like breaking into the local savings and loan versus breaking into Fort Knox. A domain registrar should have extremely tight security because they are holding the security to hundreds if not thousands of websites.”

War for Gibraltar: &quot;It would be a short and bloody conflict and would lose Spain&quot;
On Tuesday was &#39;The Telegraph&#39;; This August 28, 2013 is the rest of the British press, with &#39;The Independent&#39; in the group and &#39;The Guardian&#39; leading the way.
And several again reproduce the controversial image hung on his personal Facebook wall by the mayor of Alicante Francisco Pérez Trigueros to illustrate in his own way what would be a Spanish invasion of the Rock.
The photographic assembly is accompanied by numerous testimonies collected on a website of activists against Spain, where among other things, a member of the forum, Joe Jackson, states the following:
&quot;This image reminds me of the Argentines strolling through Port Stanley, it would be a very short and bloody conflict with Spain being the loser.&quot;
Warlike issues aside, the fact is that the British press does not mute the diplomatic tension between London and Madrid after the launch of concrete blocks by the Executive of Fabian Picardo, which prevent fishermen from fishing in the waters that surround The Rock with normality.
According to &#39;The Guardian&#39;, the alderman of the municipality of Callosa de Segura has no shortage of detractors for that image, and has &#39;unleashed the wrath&#39; with his humorous mockery of an invasion that has as symbols warplanes and the bull of Osborne, Patriotic icon par excellence. &quot;
Francisco Javier Pérez Trigueros has caused the population of 30,000 people from the British colony overseas. &quot;
And then the English newspaper recalls that the divers of the Guardia Civil posed with Spanish flags on the reef where are located the blocks that torpedo the trawling of the workers of the sea of ​​La Linea and Algeciras, among other populations.
In the London office for the Government of Gibraltar, Gibraltar House, there have been crowded trays with thousands of e-mails reporting abusive maneuvers to prevent fishing, which London calls the apparent &quot;targeted digital harassment campaign Against the British authorities&#39; from the Spanish sailors.
All this is in the midst of Picardo&#39;s London tour to meet David Cameron&#39;s Foreign Minister William Hague with a subsequent visit to The Hague on 28 August. &quot;
If Syria allows it, &quot;in the words of the Downing Street spokesperson.
War for Gibraltar: &quot;It would be a short and bloody conflict and would lose Spain&quot; :: World :: Europe :: Digital Journalist
I believe that everything will have a diplomatic solution in the interests of both parties!
The montage is a joke and shame to others.
Remind the British redneck that we are Spanish, not Italian.
But no one is going to organize a war for Gribaltar, neither the Spanish nor the British.
Gribaltar will recover when we return to being Al-Andalus, kingdom integrated in the Union of Eurabia.
As we go, in about fifty years.
Or before.

And if Spain and Argentina agreed to play the balls to the perfidious albion?

Let&#39;s see ... a fifteen year old granite from Birmingham writes an imbecility in a British forum and Digital Journalist the entrecomilla and uses as a headline.
As if in Der Spiegel he gave them the cover of Allseeyingeye or Tico.
Digital Journalist is not worth even to hack it.
Oh, and everybody knows that, militarily, RU has zero chances of regaining the rock if Spain occupied it.
Next will be the Picard saying that Spain uses chemical weapons against them.
And I say, what do you expect from some guys who throw themselves in the pool and fall out?
What can you expect from some guys who pay Don Quixote a pint of 15 bucks?
The ignorant Anglo-Saxon who speaks of the Falklands must be very young or very stupid, because if not for Chile and the Usanos the Argentines dismember them.
Otherwise do not touch the balls and if they want something they talk to my cousins:

Xinhua Middle East news summary at 2200 GMT, March 12  Xinhua Middle East news summary at 2200 GMT, March 12  RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on Tuesday called for an immediate international action to stop Israeli restrictions on Palestinian economy.  This call came after the World Bank issued a report warning that the continued deterioration of the Palestinian economy "will have lasting and costly implications for economic competitiveness and social cohesion."  The Israeli restrictions include the frequent withholding of tax revenues, keeping military checkpoints in the West Bank, restricting the some Palestinian economic activities and preventing large-scale exports, said Jawwad Naji, Palestinian minister of economy. (Palestinians-Economy)  - - - -  TEHRAN -- A senior Iranian commander said Tuesday that the Islamic republic repelled an American U2 reconnaissance plane as it was trying to enter Iran's airspace, Press TV reported.  Commander of Iran's Khatam al-Anbiya Air Defense Base Brigadier General Farzad Esmaili said that the country's air defense systems identified the radar-evading plane in southern country on Feb. 10 but the plane left the area after receiving a warning from Iran's air-defense units, according to the report. (Iran-U.S.)  - - - -  KHARTOUM -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on Tuesday agreed to visit Juba after receiving an invitation from his South Sudanese counterpart Salva Kiir Mayardit, official SUNA news agency reported.

(Sudan-South Sudan)  - - - -  BAGHDAD -- A candidate for provincial elections and a policeman were killed in two attacks in north of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Tuesday, the police said.

&quot;It does not matter if Greece leaves the euro: there is a plan B&quot;
Greece will not leave the euro, but there is a plan B so that it should pay some more than others.
It is the thesis defended by the Professor of Economic Structure of the University Ramon Llull remembering that the Hellenic country was not in the pools to enter the monetary union.
Santiago Niño Becerra defends in its Stock Market Letter that between mid-2012 and mid-2014 &quot;different financial experts&quot; have devised a plan to soften a possible exit of the euro.
Niño Becerra: &quot;there is an alternative plan, it is the same as Greece is leaving&quot;
The strategy has required of many studies but &quot;as they already have it, it does not matter as Greece &#39;leaves&#39;; Because, and the mechanism is great, it would be Greece who would leave the euro: the EMU, the rest of its members, wants Greece to stay, but to stay must fulfill what has been said, and as someone who can win the Greek elections say that you should change the deck to continue playing, it would be Greece who would go bad and break the rules. &quot;
However, the economist rejects that the Greek country is going to come out of the single currency &quot;I think that Greece will not leave nor will it be thrown out, for two very simple reasons: one: because someone is wayward, better to have it inside and controlled, Someone is weak, and two: because it is better to charge something for good than nothing for bad. &quot;
For Professor Syriza has to &quot;sign a document that has not yet signed,&quot; and investors surrender to the evidence &quot;that Greece can pay very little of what it owes unless Greece establishes a dictatorship like the Latin American The 80
But all that has to be staged. &quot;
But if the play ends in tragedy there is nothing to worry about: &quot;in case everything fails, there is already a plan B: Greece can go from the euro: the rest could assume their sad departure.
It would have to be paid between all, of course (although, as always some would pay more than others), but everything would be for the cause.

But we had not been that the Greeks can not leave the euro even if they want?
Let&#39;s see if they leave, and stop robbing the rest of Europeans. &quot;
Paying it all for the cause &quot;would have to be very mamahuevos, the amount of millions that have supposed the rescues of Greece are priceless.
I do not want to imagine for countries like Spain, Portugal or Italy to take part of that debt.
One thing is clear, the troika will not go to greece to laminate the mamandurrios and Greek chaps that are being saved from the burning; And if Greece leaves the euro even less; And that goes for here too;
.... For the professor Syriza has to &quot;sign a document that has not yet signed,&quot; and investors surrender to the evidence &quot;that Greece can pay very little of what it owes unless in Greece a dictatorship is established Like the Latin American ones of the 80s.
But all that has to be staged &quot;.....
That is the key to the issue.
If in the 1980s the countries of Ibero-America became unruly, a coup orchestrated by the USA, establishing a military government to comply with the dictates dictated by the IMF, and to neutralize the subversive elements opposed to the Free Market Laws, was the A solution that was seen as normal, nothing will prevent the Merkel area of ​​influence from seeing something similar, as Greece continues to bet on a Bolivarian government.
Does this clown still have credibility?
Does this clown still have credibility?
Ever since they&#39;d been stuck with the pasta, none.
Possible actions of Greece
Let us not forget the strategic point that Greece has.
Day 1) Syriza wins election by overwhelming majority Day 2) Greece leaves the euro and NATO, and closes borders to European countries Day 3) Greece offers and sells its Russian &quot;brothers&quot;, land for Russians to assemble their Bases in the Mediterranean, right in front of its archenemy Turkey, in exchange for oil and food supply.
Geopolitically Greece is a key bastion of Europe, to see if it is going to roll!

&quot;It does not matter if Greece leaves the euro: there is a plan B&quot;
Greece will not leave the euro, but there is a plan B so that it should pay some more than others.
It is the thesis defended by the Professor of Economic Structure of the University Ramon Llull remembering that the Hellenic country was not in the pools to enter the monetary union.
Santiago Niño Becerra defends in its Stock Market Letter that between mid-2012 and mid-2014 &quot;different financial experts&quot; have devised a plan to soften a possible exit of the euro.
Niño Becerra: &quot;there is an alternative plan, it is the same as Greece is leaving&quot;
The strategy has required of many studies but &quot;as they already have it, it does not matter as Greece &#39;leaves&#39;; Because, and the mechanism is great, it would be Greece who would leave the euro: the EMU, the rest of its members, wants Greece to stay, but to stay must fulfill what has been said, and as someone who can win the Greek elections say that you should change the deck to continue playing, it would be Greece who would go bad and break the rules. &quot;
However, the economist rejects that the Greek country is going to come out of the single currency &quot;I think that Greece will not leave nor will it be thrown out, for two very simple reasons: one: because someone is wayward, better to have it inside and controlled, Someone is weak, and two: because it is better to charge something for good than nothing for bad. &quot;
For Professor Syriza has to &quot;sign a document that has not yet signed,&quot; and investors surrender to the evidence &quot;that Greece can pay very little of what it owes unless Greece establishes a dictatorship like the Latin American The 80
But all that has to be staged. &quot;
But if the play ends in tragedy there is nothing to worry about: &quot;in case everything fails, there is already a plan B: Greece can go from the euro: the rest could assume their sad departure.
It would have to be paid between all, of course (although, as always some would pay more than others), but everything would be for the cause.

Com Niño Becerra: &quot;It does not matter if Greece leaves the euro: there is a plan B&quot; - Bolsamania.
com
But we had not been that the Greeks can not leave the euro even if they want?
Let&#39;s see if they leave, and stop robbing the rest of Europeans. &quot;
Paying it all for the cause &quot;would have to be very mamahuevos, the amount of millions that have supposed the rescues of Greece are priceless.
I do not want to imagine for countries like Spain, Portugal or Italy to take part of that debt.
One thing is clear, the troika will not go to greece to laminate the mamandurrios and Greek chaps that are being saved from the burning; And if Greece leaves the euro even less; And that goes for here too;
.... For the professor Syriza has to &quot;sign a document that has not yet signed,&quot; and investors surrender to the evidence &quot;that Greece can pay very little of what it owes unless in Greece a dictatorship is established Like the Latin American ones of the 80s.
But all that has to be staged &quot;.....
That is the key to the issue.
If in the 1980s the countries of Ibero-America became unruly, a coup orchestrated by the USA, establishing a military government to comply with the dictates dictated by the IMF, and to neutralize the subversive elements opposed to the Free Market Laws, was the A solution that was seen as normal, nothing will prevent the Merkel area of ​​influence from seeing something similar, as Greece continues to bet on a Bolivarian government.
Does this clown still have credibility?
Does this clown still have credibility?
Ever since they&#39;d been stuck with the pasta, none.
Possible actions of Greece
Let us not forget the strategic point that Greece has.
Day 1) Syriza wins election by overwhelming majority Day 2) Greece leaves the euro and NATO, and closes borders to European countries Day 3) Greece offers and sells its Russian &quot;brothers&quot;, land for Russians to assemble their Bases in the Mediterranean, right in front of its archenemy Turkey, in exchange for oil and food supply.
Geopolitically Greece is a key bastion of Europe, to see if it is going to roll!

&quot;It does not matter if Greece leaves the euro: there is a plan B&quot;
Greece will not leave the euro, but there is a plan B so that it should pay some more than others.
It is the thesis defended by the Professor of Economic Structure of the University Ramon Llull remembering that the Hellenic country was not in the pools to enter the monetary union.
Santiago Niño Becerra defends in its Stock Market Letter that between mid-2012 and mid-2014 &quot;different financial experts&quot; have devised a plan to soften a possible exit of the euro.
Niño Becerra: &quot;there is an alternative plan, it is the same as Greece is leaving&quot;
The strategy has required of many studies but &quot;as they already have it, it does not matter as Greece &#39;leaves&#39;; Because, and the mechanism is great, it would be Greece who would leave the euro: the EMU, the rest of its members, wants Greece to stay, but to stay must fulfill what has been said, and as someone who can win the Greek elections say that you should change the deck to continue playing, it would be Greece who would go bad and break the rules. &quot;
However, the economist rejects that the Greek country is going to come out of the single currency &quot;I think that Greece will not leave nor will it be thrown out, for two very simple reasons: one: because someone is wayward, better to have it inside and controlled, Someone is weak, and two: because it is better to charge something for good than nothing for bad. &quot;
For Professor Syriza has to &quot;sign a document that has not yet signed,&quot; and investors surrender to the evidence &quot;that Greece can pay very little of what it owes unless Greece establishes a dictatorship like the Latin American The 80
But all that has to be staged. &quot;
But if the play ends in tragedy there is nothing to worry about: &quot;in case everything fails, there is already a plan B: Greece can go from the euro: the rest could assume their sad departure.
It would have to be paid between all, of course (although, as always some would pay more than others), but everything would be for the cause.

But we had not been that the Greeks can not leave the euro even if they want?
Let&#39;s see if they leave, and stop robbing the rest of Europeans. &quot;
Paying it all for the cause &quot;would have to be very mamahuevos, the amount of millions that have supposed the rescues of Greece are priceless.
I do not want to imagine for countries like Spain, Portugal or Italy to take part of that debt.
One thing is clear, the troika will not go to greece to laminate the mamandurrios and Greek chaps that are being saved from the burning; And if Greece leaves the euro even less; And that goes for here too;
.... For the professor Syriza has to &quot;sign a document that has not yet signed,&quot; and investors surrender to the evidence &quot;that Greece can pay very little of what it owes unless in Greece a dictatorship is established Like the Latin American ones of the 80s.
But all that has to be staged &quot;.....
That is the key to the issue.
If in the 1980s the countries of Ibero-America became unruly, a coup orchestrated by the USA, establishing a military government to comply with the dictates dictated by the IMF, and to neutralize the subversive elements opposed to the Free Market Laws, was the A solution that was seen as normal, nothing will prevent the Merkel area of ​​influence from seeing something similar, as Greece continues to bet on a Bolivarian government.
Does this clown still have credibility?
Does this clown still have credibility?
Ever since they&#39;d been stuck with the pasta, none.
Possible actions of Greece
Let us not forget the strategic point that Greece has.
Day 1) Syriza wins election by overwhelming majority Day 2) Greece leaves the euro and NATO, and closes borders to European countries Day 3) Greece offers and sells its Russian &quot;brothers&quot;, land for Russians to assemble their Bases in the Mediterranean, right in front of its archenemy Turkey, in exchange for oil and food supply.
Geopolitically Greece is a key bastion of Europe, to see if it is going to roll!

Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners
Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners-NBC News
At least five bomb threats were phoned in Tuesday against flights originating or landing in the United States, government sources told NBC News.
The sources said that the threats were not considered credible.
Four of the five flights - one each from US Airways, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and the Mexican carrier Volaris - landed.
The fifth, Korean Air Flight 23 from Seoul to San Francisco, was still in the air, scheduled to land Tuesday afternoon.
In Philadelphia, police met the US Airways plane, Flight 648 from San Diego, when it landed.
NBC Philadelphia reported that a police squad, including dogs, searched the plane and passengers and gave the all-clear.
Bomb Threats against Various US Aircraft In full flight Bomb threats against several US aircraft. In mid-flight
Several US planes in mid-flight - and one on the ground at Philadelphia airport - have received multiple bomb threats, reports NBC News.
The threats to US aviation that took place this Tuesday are similar to the multiple reports of a possible use of chemical weapons against it that occurred last week, reports NBC News.
It was then determined that the claims were false, even speculating that they could have been carried out by a lone wolf from the terrorist organization of the Islamic State.
BREAKING: Bomb threats made against several plans in the air.

It seems that Brown can be armed, bomb threats in airplanes, failing to confirm, and these threats are not credible, and it seems that there are 4 or 5 planes that have landed:

Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners
Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners-NBC News
At least five bomb threats were phoned in Tuesday against flights originating or landing in the United States, government sources told NBC News.
The sources said that the threats were not considered credible.
Four of the five flights - one each from US Airways, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and the Mexican carrier Volaris - landed.
The fifth, Korean Air Flight 23 from Seoul to San Francisco, was still in the air, scheduled to land Tuesday afternoon.
In Philadelphia, police met the US Airways plane, Flight 648 from San Diego, when it landed.
NBC Philadelphia reported that a police squad, including dogs, searched the plane and passengers and gave the all-clear.
Bomb Threats against Various US Aircraft In full flight Bomb threats against several US aircraft. In mid-flight
Several US planes in mid-flight - and one on the ground at Philadelphia airport - have received multiple bomb threats, reports NBC News.
The threats to US aviation that took place this Tuesday are similar to the multiple reports of a possible use of chemical weapons against it that occurred last week, reports NBC News.
It was then determined that the claims were false, even speculating that they could have been carried out by a lone wolf from the terrorist organization of the Islamic State.
BREAKING: Bomb threats made against several plans in the air.

It seems that Brown can be armed, bomb threats in airplanes, failing to confirm, and these threats are not credible, and it seems that there are 4 or 5 planes that have landed:

Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners
Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners-NBC News
At least five bomb threats were phoned in Tuesday against flights originating or landing in the United States, government sources told NBC News.
The sources said that the threats were not considered credible.
Four of the five flights - one each from US Airways, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and the Mexican carrier Volaris - landed.
The fifth, Korean Air Flight 23 from Seoul to San Francisco, was still in the air, scheduled to land Tuesday afternoon.
In Philadelphia, police met the US Airways plane, Flight 648 from San Diego, when it landed.
NBC Philadelphia reported that a police squad, including dogs, searched the plane and passengers and gave the all-clear.
Bomb Threats against Various US Aircraft In full flight Bomb threats against several US aircraft. In mid-flight
Several US planes in mid-flight - and one on the ground at Philadelphia airport - have received multiple bomb threats, reports NBC News.
The threats to US aviation that took place this Tuesday are similar to the multiple reports of a possible use of chemical weapons against it that occurred last week, reports NBC News.
It was then determined that the claims were false, even speculating that they could have been carried out by a lone wolf from the terrorist organization of the Islamic State.
BREAKING: Bomb threats made against several plans in the air.

It seems that Brown can be armed, bomb threats in airplanes, failing to confirm, and these threats are not credible, and it seems that there are 4 or 5 planes that have landed:

Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners
Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners-NBC News
At least five bomb threats were phoned in Tuesday against flights originating or landing in the United States, government sources told NBC News.
The sources said that the threats were not considered credible.
Four of the five flights - one each from US Airways, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and the Mexican carrier Volaris - landed.
The fifth, Korean Air Flight 23 from Seoul to San Francisco, was still in the air, scheduled to land Tuesday afternoon.
In Philadelphia, police met the US Airways plane, Flight 648 from San Diego, when it landed.
NBC Philadelphia reported that a police squad, including dogs, searched the plane and passengers and gave the all-clear.
Bomb Threats against Various US Aircraft In full flight Bomb threats against several US aircraft. In mid-flight
Several US planes in mid-flight - and one on the ground at Philadelphia airport - have received multiple bomb threats, reports NBC News.
The threats to US aviation that took place this Tuesday are similar to the multiple reports of a possible use of chemical weapons against it that occurred last week, reports NBC News.
It was then determined that the claims were false, even speculating that they could have been carried out by a lone wolf from the terrorist organization of the Islamic State.
BREAKING: Bomb threats made against several plans in the air.
Via @tomcostelloNBC 2:20 PM - 2 Jun 2015
It seems that Brown can be armed, bomb threats in airplanes, failing to confirm, and these threats are not credible, and it seems that there are 4 or 5 planes that have landed:

Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners
Bomb Threats Made Against Least Five Airliners-NBC News
At least five bomb threats were phoned in Tuesday against flights originating or landing in the United States, government sources told NBC News.
The sources said that the threats were not considered credible.
Four of the five flights - one each from US Airways, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and the Mexican carrier Volaris - landed.
The fifth, Korean Air Flight 23 from Seoul to San Francisco, was still in the air, scheduled to land Tuesday afternoon.
In Philadelphia, police met the US Airways plane, Flight 648 from San Diego, when it landed.
NBC Philadelphia reported that a police squad, including dogs, searched the plane and passengers and gave the all-clear.
Bomb Threats against Various US Aircraft In full flight Bomb threats against several US aircraft. In mid-flight
Several US planes in mid-flight - and one on the ground at Philadelphia airport - have received multiple bomb threats, reports NBC News.
The threats to US aviation that took place this Tuesday are similar to the multiple reports of a possible use of chemical weapons against it that occurred last week, reports NBC News.
It was then determined that the claims were false, even speculating that they could have been carried out by a lone wolf from the terrorist organization of the Islamic State.
BREAKING: Bomb threats made against several plans in the air.
Via @tomcostelloNBC 2:20 PM - 2 Jun 2015
It seems that Brown can be armed, bomb threats in airplanes, failing to confirm, and these threats are not credible, and it seems that there are 4 or 5 planes that have landed:

The last one of Rafael Correa: It sends to the UN to take by sack
Getting bigger and bigger.
Rafael Correa calls on the UN not to get into &quot;sovereign decisions of Ecuador
President Rafael Correa, on his sabatino liaison from Macas, questioned the United Nations that on November 4 he asked his Government to explain why he did not decriminalize abortion, an issue that was included in the new Integral Penal Code approved by the National Assembly. Past December 17th.
For the president, the UN may have its ideas &quot;but their values ​​can not be universal values&quot;.
He regretted that the ambassador of Ecuador in Geneva, Luis Gallegos, responded to this request from four rapporteurs of the organization&#39;s Human Rights Council so that within 60 days the Government will explain the measures taken to ensure consistency Between the Code, the Constitution and the country&#39;s international human rights obligations; And to ensure the enjoyment of women&#39;s right to sexual and reproductive health. &quot;
We are going to make the adjustments of the case because that should have been communicated to the Foreign Ministry (in Quito) to answer properly.
Gentlemen (UN) are going to get involved in their affairs not in sovereign decisions of Ecuador, &quot;said the president.
The Penal Code states that abortion is not punishable when the life of the mother is at risk or if the pregnancy is the result of rape of a woman with a mental disability.
Correa does not have the &quot;slightest doubt that abortion is a crime&quot; and said that the United Nations has every right to think as they like but &quot;they have no right to try to impose their barbarity and there is a terrible double standard&quot; .
And he set the example of Uruguay when he decriminalized marijuana where the UN asked him for explanations, but he did not pass the decriminalization of narcotics in two states of the United States (Colorado and California). &quot;
They treat us as colonies, that&#39;s part of neocolonialism; To free the Ecuadorian people not to accept illegitimate and illegitimate intrusions of this international bureaucracy, often taken by certain groups of power ... we come to demand what they never fulfilled ... comes caretuco, &quot;said the president.
Rafael Correa calls on the UN not to get into &quot;sovereign decisions of Ecuador&quot; - Politics | The universe
With two balls if sir
I hope it is not, but to see how long it takes to get a cancer like Chavez
Nevertheless the antiracismo, progresismo, right humanism, multiculturalism and other dogmas UN yes it likes to maintain to its parasites in Spain.
Great not, ready yes.
Hypocritical and false as well.
He has read The Prince, and he has understood it.
That is why he is a good ruler.
Very big.
The Aido UN and all the other crap that gets into your fucking house, this is Manhattan, there they are fine.
That is why progress can not support Correa.
Nevertheless the antiracismo, progresismo, right humanism, multiculturalism and other dogmas UN yes it likes to maintain to its parasites in Spain.
Great not, ready yes.
Hypocritical and false as well.
As far as I know, he is the only leader who has campaigned for immigrants to return, he also seems to be the typical dogma of faith that Galeano writes and now defends the Spanish heritage in Ecuador, nor has he drawn laws of gender ideology Style as dictated by the UN and have approved here, nor pay for being indigenous, prefer to try to develop the areas where they live and I do not see anything wrong with that.
Go Strap go!
And the Glasterthurn walks preaching that Correa is a NOM pawn.
Undoubtedly, this news confirms this.

Same as Putin
Anita Pástor and her husband the flintstone disapprove this thread for xemófogo and ..
Put what you want.
I hope that when Correa takes measures like nationalizing companies, raising taxes higher incomes, the cheeky faces will support you too.

You will have to see the circumstances if you do, in any case it is not a garrulo like the late Hugo Chavez, nor need to divert attention from anything like Botox.
In addition there are several types of nationalizations, if it is for the good of your country, according.

The last one of Rafael Correa: It sends to the UN to take by sack
Getting bigger and bigger.
Rafael Correa calls on the UN not to get into &quot;sovereign decisions of Ecuador
President Rafael Correa, on his sabatino liaison from Macas, questioned the United Nations that on November 4 he asked his Government to explain why he did not decriminalize abortion, an issue that was included in the new Integral Penal Code approved by the National Assembly. Past December 17th.
For the president, the UN may have its ideas &quot;but their values ​​can not be universal values&quot;.
He regretted that the ambassador of Ecuador in Geneva, Luis Gallegos, responded to this request from four rapporteurs of the organization&#39;s Human Rights Council so that within 60 days the Government will explain the measures taken to ensure consistency Between the Code, the Constitution and the country&#39;s international human rights obligations; And to ensure the enjoyment of women&#39;s right to sexual and reproductive health. &quot;
We are going to make the adjustments of the case because that should have been communicated to the Foreign Ministry (in Quito) to answer properly.
Gentlemen (UN) are going to get involved in their affairs not in sovereign decisions of Ecuador, &quot;said the president.
The Penal Code states that abortion is not punishable when the life of the mother is at risk or if the pregnancy is the result of rape of a woman with a mental disability.
Correa does not have the &quot;slightest doubt that abortion is a crime&quot; and said that the United Nations has every right to think as they like but &quot;they have no right to try to impose their barbarity and there is a terrible double standard&quot; .
And he set the example of Uruguay when he decriminalized marijuana where the UN asked him for explanations, but he did not pass the decriminalization of narcotics in two states of the United States (Colorado and California). &quot;
They treat us as colonies, that&#39;s part of neocolonialism; To free the Ecuadorian people not to accept illegitimate and illegitimate intrusions of this international bureaucracy, often taken by certain groups of power ... we come to demand what they never fulfilled ... comes caretuco, &quot;said the president.
Rafael Correa calls on the UN not to get into &quot;sovereign decisions of Ecuador&quot; - Politics | The universe
With two balls if sir
I hope it is not, but to see how long it takes to get a cancer like Chavez
Nevertheless the antiracismo, progresismo, right humanism, multiculturalism and other dogmas UN yes it likes to maintain to its parasites in Spain.
Great not, ready yes.
Hypocritical and false as well.
He has read The Prince, and he has understood it.
That is why he is a good ruler.
Very big.
The Aido UN and all the other crap that gets into your fucking house, this is Manhattan, there they are fine.
That is why progress can not support Correa.

Great not, ready yes.
Hypocritical and false as well.
As far as I know, he is the only leader who has campaigned for immigrants to return, he also seems to be the typical dogma of faith that Galeano writes and now defends the Spanish heritage in Ecuador, nor has he drawn laws of gender ideology Style as dictated by the UN and have approved here, nor pay for being indigenous, prefer to try to develop the areas where they live and I do not see anything wrong with that.
Go Strap go!
And the Glasterthurn walks preaching that Correa is a NOM pawn.
Undoubtedly, this news confirms this.

Same as Putin
Anita Pástor and her husband the flintstone disapprove this thread for xemófogo and ..
Put what you want.
I hope that when Correa takes measures like nationalizing companies, raising taxes higher incomes, the cheeky faces will support you too.

You will have to see the circumstances if you do, in any case it is not a garrulo like the late Hugo Chavez, nor need to divert attention from anything like Botox.
In addition there are several types of nationalizations, if it is for the good of your country, according.

Will Minister Guindos be the next president of the Eurogroup?
Dijsselbloem: &quot;Spain believes it is entitled to a heavy position in Brussels when it does not have it&quot; The president of the Eurogroup is critical of the voices pointing to Luis de Guindos as his successor
Brussels, (EFECOM).
- Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem today criticized Spain&#39;s intention to chair the informal forum of ministers of economy and finance of the eurozone, saying that the Spanish government &quot;believes it has the right&quot; to ask for a Weight in Brussels when &quot;it does not have it&quot;.
The Dutch finance minister also reacted in a statement to the Dutch media to the support given by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the Minister of Economy and Competitiveness, Luis de Guindos, to take over the presidency of the Eurogroup after the end of the year. Mandate of Dijsselbloem in 2015.
He said he was &quot;aware&quot; of the German leader&#39;s statements, which said Monday that he supports De Guindos being the next president of this informal forum that brings together the eighteen heads of the eurozone&#39;s Economy and Finance, Proved to be an &quot;excellent&quot; minister &quot;in difficult times&quot;.
However, he reiterated that at the moment there is only one president of the Eurogroup and this is him, having been appointed in January 2013 by his colleagues, the finance ministers, for a term of two and a half years, that is until the summer of the next year.
The question of his successor will be raised &quot;for that in more than a year and not now,&quot; he said in statements collected by the Dutch agency ANP. &quot;
I am sure I will be still a year.
We will not distribute positions that are not vacant &quot;, emphasized Dijsselbloem.
ANP calls the reaction of the Dutch Minister of Finance in his assessment of the performance of De Guindos as a minister a &quot;somewhat parka&quot;, saying that we still have to wait to see if the country and the Spanish banks have left the crisis. &quot;
Much work has been done, but it is not yet certain whether Spain is already there (outside the crisis), &quot;said Dijsselbloem.
According to Dijsselbloem, Spain has been claiming for some time a position with weight in Brussels and &quot;believes he has a right to something, but he does not have it.&quot;
The president of the Eurogroup also said that next year there will be elections in Spain and that De Guindos&#39; chances of becoming his successor will depend on whether or not the party in the government will assume a second term, according to ANP.
Dijsselbloem avoided commenting on whether he could become the next Dutch commissioner in the European Commission (EC) to lead Jean-Claude Juncker. &quot;
I already have a job.
It is more in fact two, &quot;as his country&#39;s finance minister and president of the Eurogroup, he said, while he declined to reveal whether he intends to extend his mandate in that forum when it expires on 21 July 2015, because that question is only Will pose then.
The chances of Dijsselbloem joining the college of commissioners under Juncker are relatively small, given that both are &quot;not exactly friends,&quot; according to sources familiar with their relationship.
Dijsselbloem described Juncker earlier this year in a Dutch program of humorous interviews as &quot;an inveterate smoker and drinker,&quot; something that has saddled his predecessor in the Eurogroup.

And does Holland have that right?
What an argument.
Hello salami
The donkey and the apple ... decide who is each of you ...
The &quot;Guindito de la calzada&quot; curriculum says it all.
Amos, do not fuck with me ...
And Holland, yes?
What subidito they have some.
Do not forget that our dear guindo is an expert in creating crísis, he was part of Lehman Brothers, nobody is better qualified for the position than he who knows how to manage crises and get us out of the impasse.
Seriously, after the multiple blows of Rajao to the Merkel surely they give it to him.
They are things of castauzos that do not come or come to me.
Here you will be squeezing this Chiquito or Donald Duck.

Fully open to the road of the Camino in La Rioja
The President of the Government of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, inaugurated the last section, together with the Minister of Development, Ana Pastor, and the president of La Rioja, Pedro Sanz.
Rajoy, along with the Minister of Public Works, Ana Pastor, and the President of the Government of La Rioja, Pedro Sanz, has inaugurated the last stretch of La Rioja of A-12, between Hormilla and Hervías, formed by 12 kilometers, An investment budget of 44.35 million euros and put into service four months ahead of schedule.
The president of the central government, Mariano Rajoy, said Wednesday, in the municipality of La Rioja Hormilla, that &quot;Spain has a high level of infrastructure.&quot;
Rajoy, along with the Minister of Public Works, Ana Pastor, and the President of the Government of La Rioja, Pedro Sanz, has inaugurated the last stretch of La Rioja of A-12, between Hormilla and Hervías, formed by 12 kilometers, An investment budget of 44.35 million euros and put into service four months ahead of schedule.
Rajoy, with the act of this Wednesday, is the first motorway that inaugurates and the first time that, as president of the Government, he visits La Rioja, which he has traveled on several occasions before.
Acknowledgments
The President of the Community of La Rioja, Pedro Sanz, thanked the Government of Spain for &quot;the effort and the commitment, in an especially complicated economic context, so that the dual carriageway of the Camino (A-12) Travel along La Rioja &quot;.
The Government of La Rioja assures that this action will offer to the substantial travelers improvements in terms of security and reduction of the time of displacement.
Around 10.000 vehicles circulate daily by the A-12 in this point (27% of the traffic corresponds with trucks and buses).
Since 1998
It is the only motorway that crosses the autonomous community and facilitates communication with Pamplona and Burgos.
Its construction began in 1998 with the Logroño bypass (LO-20), which entered service a year later, and its conclusion has been possible more than fifteen years later after an investment of more than 200 million euros.
Following this first stretch in La Rioja, the following routes were followed: Navarrete variant (in service in 2002), Nájera-Hormilla (2008), Hormilla-Hervías (2014) and Hervías-Grañón (2012).
However, in this case, the road between Santo Domingo de la Calzada and Grañón, with 4.2 km, is pending, which is part of the project that affects the first stretch in Burgos to the town of Villamayor del Río.
At the beginning of 2015: the connection between La Rioja and Navarre
The president of La Rioja has pointed out that for the first months of 2015 the connection of the A-12 between La Rioja and Navarra (6.5 km) will be ready, as confirmed by the Minister of Public Works in his visit to the works on the week pass. &quot;
In this case also said that the work would be finished in 2011, but the truth is that it will end four years later &quot;after an investment of more than 100 million euros.
Around 2020: between Pamplona and Burgos
The Ministry of Development has established that the entire route between Pamplona and Burgos, with 219.4 km, will be completed by 2020.
At present, the four sections that run through the province of Burgos are in the process of drafting projects (Santo Domingo de la Calzada - Villamayor del Río, Villamayor del Río-Villafranca de los Montes de Oca, Villafranca de los Montes de Oca - Ibeas Of Juarros and Ibeas de Juarros - Burgos).

[CharacterOffsetBeginAnnotation=486 CharacterOffsetEndAnnotation=626 TokenBeginAnnotation=486 TokenEndAnnotation=626 TextAnnotation=In Ankara, Turkey, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an ideological ally of Morsi’s, called for an early meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss what he called a “massacre.”   The Brotherhood, for decades the repository of Islamist sentiment, said it wanted millions to march Friday to display “the pain and sorrow over the loss of our martyrs.” In a statement, the Brotherhood said the actions of the military-backed interim government against Morsi’s supporters had “increased our determination to end them.”   With their leaders jailed or silent, however, some Islamists reeled in shock at the killings Wednesday when security forces razed two protest camps where Morsi’s supporters had been staging sit-ins since his ouster six weeks ago.

  EGYPT'S ISLAMISTS TAKE TO STREETS IN SHOW OF RAGE AT CRACKDOWN    EDS: ADDS graf beginning “In the initial confusion...”; NEW headline; MINOR edits to first and third grafs.); David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Cairo, and Alan Cowell from London. Mayy El Sheikh and Kareem Fahim contributed reporting from Cairo.   CAIRO - Facing police officers authorized to use lethal force if threatened, thousands of followers of the embattled Muslim Brotherhood took to the streets of Cairo on Friday as the Islamist organization sought to regain momentum after a crushing crackdown by security forces Wednesday in which almost 640 people were killed.   In the initial confusion, witnesses spoke of gunfire whistling over a main overpass in Cairo and at a downtown square as clashes erupted and police fired tear gas. New fatalities were reported from the northwestern city of Ismailiya, but details were scarce.   Under military lockdown after authorities declared a state of emergency, Cairo and other cities had been bracing for more violence after Friday Prayer, which has been a central trigger for protest since the wave of turmoil once known as the Arab Spring swept through the region beginning in early 2011.   In response to the call for what the Brotherhood called a “Friday of rage,” thousands of supporters of the deposed president, Mohammed Morsi, marched from northeast Cairo after the noon prayer, witnesses said, defying a show of strength from the military.   The protesters headed toward Ramses Square downtown, but there were no immediate reports of clashes. For its part, the army and security forces sealed off streets and positioned armored vehicles in Tahrir Square, once the crucible of broad revolt but now a stronghold of Morsi opponents.   The outcome of the growing confrontation between secular and Islamist forces in Egypt - a contest that could shape the country and the region for years to come - seemed cloaked in uncertainty.   “After the blows and arrests and killings that we are facing, emotions are too high to be guided by anyone,” said a Brotherhood spokesman, Gehad el-Haddad, according to Reuters.   The clash of powerful forces has alarmed many outsiders stunned by the ferocity of the crackdown and fearful of the potential regional repercussions. On Friday, news reports from Paris said President François Hollande consulted Britain and Germany about the crisis, but it was not immediately clear how the situation could be swayed by outsiders’ diplomacy.   On Thursday, some European officials called for a suspension of aid by the European Union, and at least one member state, Denmark, cut off support. The British and French summoned their Egyptian ambassadors to condemn the violence. In Ankara, Turkey, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an ideological ally of Morsi’s, called for an early meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss what he called a “massacre.”   The Brotherhood, for decades the repository of Islamist sentiment, said it wanted millions to march Friday to display “the pain and sorrow over the loss of our martyrs.” In a statement, the Brotherhood said the actions of the military-backed interim government against Morsi’s supporters had “increased our determination to end them.”   With their leaders jailed or silent, however, some Islamists reeled in shock at the killings Wednesday when security forces razed two protest camps where Morsi’s supporters had been staging sit-ins since his ouster six weeks ago. By Thursday night, health officials had counted 638 dead and nearly 4,000 injured, but the final toll was expected to rise, in the worst mass killing in Egypt’s modern history.

Microsoft officially cancels the project so Windows 10 Mobile is compatible with Android apps
Microsoft officially cancels the project so Windows 10 Mobile is compatible with Android apps
Microsoft officially cancels the project so Windows 10 Mobile is compatible with Android apps
It is something that was already rumored last January, but today has been officially confirmed by Microsoft.
Those of Redmond were involved in two projects to be able to turn Windows 10 Mobile into a system compatible with Android and iOS apps.
Already at that time there was talk of a cancellation of this program for Android apps and that was fully invested in iOS, something that today has confirmed openly and officially Microsoft.
As you all know, the application catalog of the Microsoft store is very limited, and is probably one of the main reasons why users still prefer Android or iOS instead of a phone with Windows 10 Mobile.
In fact, the Microsoft store has only about a quarter of the apps offered by the other two major operating systems.
Plans to end this problem happen because Microsoft facilitates the adaptation of the apps to its operating system.
The fastest way is to make the operating system compatible with the native Android or iOS apps through a &quot;bridge&quot; in this way the programmers would have no problem to be able to launch them on the Microsoft system.
The Redmond have two projects under way, one to make iOS apps compatible and another to Android, the latter called Astoria.
Now Microsoft has officially announced that it leaves this latest project through an official statement.
According to this release Microsoft wants to make iOS compatible with Windows 10 with their apps not because they are better than Android, but because being compatible with one of these two platforms, Windows 10 Mobile and enjoy all those apps that are missing In their store, so it would not be necessary to do the same with Android, where a major bulk of apps are shared with iTunes, although of course there are many exceptions, but broadly share much of the catalog.
But this is not the only reason, but also the purchase of Xamarin a few hours ago by Microsoft has precipitated this decision, as the latter company will allow Microsoft to offer better alternatives when it comes to compatibilizar applications with the Microsoft operating system .
With the compatibility of iOS and Xamarin, Microsoft has thought it unnecessary to invest money and effort in making a third platform compatible.
Regardless of whether it&#39;s Android apps, iOS or other platforms, what&#39;s important is that the catalog of the Windows 10 Mobile store grows enough to become a serious alternative to major operating systems.
Otherwise, the date of death of the system will be very close.
What I see is that while Android dominates the market, iOS dominates revenue by applications.
In that context Microsoft chooses to go with the rich cousin.

And if you do not want to update, every day with the murga del cartelito.
Worse than the phone commercials, listen.
I find it very well, I would do the same.
Android is a fucking cancer, every day with updates.
Brutal, can give a return to the market.

  Commercials that made you laugh out loud   I just love the Fruit of the Loom one: http://www.fruitcountryvideo.com/video.html It's maybe been around for some time, but we're just getting back Stateside after a while. Any others that made (make) you laugh? Links? X   Duff-Man says...not a TV commercial, but a print ad...I saw it in a recent issue of Sound-on-Sound and it was for Mackie's Tracktion 2 audio software..anyway, the ad says "If your music sucks, it will still suck. You'll just make it a whole lot faster."...great ad.....oh yeah!   http://www.visit4info.com/details.cfm?adid=9115  there was another one I saw with a lady unloading groceries and lost her temper something fierce, it was hilarious, but I didn't find it from my weak search on google    I have also enjoyed the recent Fruit of the Loom commercials on TV. They are well done with great music. Something to bring a smile to the face. Real feel good commercials.  That was quite a temper tantrum by that child. Quite a cute commercial for condoms.   I love that coca-cola commercial with that wannabe rapper delux 247 acting like he's a brutha!!!   I laughed at the Starburst commercial where the guy is trying to shoot the starburst into his friend's mouth and he knocks him over, and then another guy comes running up and grabs the Starburst that is sticking to the second guy's head and eats it. It's so stupid, but so funny!    http://www.visit4info.com/details.cfm?adid=9115  there was another one I saw with a lady unloading groceries and lost her temper something fierce, it was hilarious, but I didn't find it from my weak search on google    LOL. Being a father of two it was very easy to relate to. I was laughing so hard that my PB fell off my lap onto the carpet. Thank you - that made my day!

Any others that made (make) you laugh? Links? X   Too funny    http://www.visit4info.com/details.cfm?adid=9115  there was another one I saw with a lady unloading groceries and lost her temper something fierce, it was hilarious, but I didn't find it from my weak search on google    Great AD, even though it could never be aired in America... D!@# Conservatives and Christian Coalition   The Lance Armstrong discovery channel commercial with the Teutuls (sp) from Orange County Choppers was a laugh out loud commercial. They change Lances bike into a chopper and Lance walks in the room and just has the greatest look on his face like WHAT DID YOU DO! The mikey says sorry Lance and the dad yells SHUT UP!    Great AD, even though it could never be aired in America... D!@# Conservatives and Christian Coalition   Condom ads air in the States. I've seen them on the cable channels.  "Trojan Man" has aired several times, in fact.....  Trojan Ad Link  ABC News Link   Though no formal government or industry restrictions prevent condom commercials from being shown in prime time, condom ads have traditionally been banished to late-night hours or cable networks. But television airwaves have recently become more open to products dealing with sexual health, evidenced by frequent network commercials for erectile dysfunction drugs and female contraception.    I forget what they were selling but 2 guys are on the highway on the outskirts of Las Vegas. They are cheerful and happy that they are going to Vegas. Then 24 hours later you see them driving away from the city with looks on their faces like they were ass-raped.

My response was to the direct in your face message of the commercial, not the product. Yes, I have seen the Trojan Man commercials.   The ad in the link is far more in-your-face than the one that started this thread, imho. Attached Files: tv_ad.jpg File size: 16.3 KB Views: 151

Crisis? - Forum
There is a theme there that the world is going to end in 2012.
Another that Miss Zazil has initiated on the &quot;problems&quot;, in short, many in which this could be incorporated.
There is a subforum of &quot;News&quot;.
And nothing.
I sat for a few days thinking someone would mention it.
And nothing.
I thought that if I put it would not lack the comment on agorerismo, so that I sat down.
But nothing.
Now: Did anyone find out that there is a frightening, but horribly frightening &quot;Crisis&quot; that can lead us to the end long before 2012?
That they fall the number one banks of the planet and there are not billions of dollars that raise them?
That food has risen more than 50% in one year, other than oil?
And that we are actually beginning and that will touch us, yes or yes?
Although perhaps to this it would have to put it in &quot;Only Games&quot; or as the subforum is called.
Je, be careful do not say it very loudly, do not go to be banned for an omen ...
The truth is that I&#39;m a little shit, the situation is worrisome, not only because everyone releases the same comments as you, but because the analysts do not know where the thing is going to throw.
This feeling of ignorance, in addition to generating a great insecurity in the citizenship also paralyzes the organisms that maybe, could do something, I have the impression that it is the whiting that bites its tail.
But, well, if we can avoid the war, we can be happy.
Apocalypse ... Armageddon is called, it is written.
Well you see, it should be in the Games Forum.
And I urge you to say that the most invoked answer would be &quot;to take care of those who have to occupy&quot;.
And that&#39;s because in reality, this is starting to feel (start, started long ago), and the &quot;wholesale&quot; banks begins to spill down.
To top it all, converging (albeit with equal root), with the rise of oil and food, which is strictly what we just perceived in the areas of decline.
Yesterday two things happened: the first that &quot;responsible people&quot; began to appear: Perez and Rodriguez, Gomez and Gonzalez, seven or eight guys who seem to have seen the situation wrong, and withdrew with a few coins of compensation.
Which is to say that between 7 and 8, they have put the system on the floor, at risk of breaking into a thousand pieces and that the world goes to hell.
What a system!
What Saddam, Osama, &quot;the Russians&quot;, hackers of all kinds, anti-globalization movements and tutti quanti, could not seem to achieve 7 or 8 .... mmmm ... something smells bad, and not just in Denmark.
The second, that the kings of &quot;no state intervention&quot;, of the total supremacy of &quot;market laws&quot;, now &quot;intervene&quot; &quot;injecting 240 billion dollars into the banking system, so that it does not fall.
They will, of course, make exceptional circumstances.
The silly question: Those 240 ... who are they?
Are not they the sum of those of Don Pepe, Dona Maria, Juanita, Enzo, Ramon, Cecilia and a couple more?
The second silly question: In addition to the banks and the rush to sustain them with &quot;injections,&quot; these types were set in this year&#39;s UN reports on the growth in the last twelve months of the millions who died of starvation?
What a system!
But no, this is to be a dozer, live the happiness, the love, the hope ... and that they take care of this that they have to occupy ... Like a hambur, I take a light ... and chau
Rebound !!!
The bags of the world bounced upwards ... and happiness, love and hope for the fools who do not believe ... Did you see that it was nothing?
... These agoreros .... It is true ... it is true ... it will not cost 240 billion dollars the anticrisis plan ... it will cost 700 billion ... well ... it is not so much ... a Four or five dollars per head we already have for a motherfucker .... To the fools who are interested in this kind of nonsense, I recommend reading the opinions of Ed Phelps, that Nobel Prize in Economics last year, it seems to me, Nothing suspicious of silly things like one&#39;s.
As long as ... just a coffee, waiter ... I have to start saving for the plan.
Something is going to touch me to put ... everything is for the hope of having it ... to the hope, I say

An aggression of &quot;young Muslims&quot; to white girls provokes tensions in an English city (Video)
The broadcast of a video showing an aggression of young Pakistanis to white girls has generated great tension in Ashton-under-Lyne.
The video, which has already been removed from You Tube, can still be seen in Live-Leak.
Last week, several minors of both sexes who were at a bus stop in the Ashton town (on the outskirts of Manchester) were harassed and violently beaten by male &quot;British&quot; criminals of Pakistani origin armed with sticks.
The broadcast of the video on the Internet soon provoked outrage in Ashton and fears were triggered by a wave of unrest; However, there have been no incidents in the interracial zone.
Ghffar Hussain, an &quot;expert&quot; on terrorism issues, told the newspaper The Commentator that the incident is only a confrontation between &quot;gangs&quot; whose members have a lot of free time; Has also ensured that the religious question is oblivious to what happened and with Islamic self-confidence has been cackled: &quot;The extreme right is to blame for everything, because it tries to demonize the British Muslims.&quot;
LiveLeak.
With-Muslims attack White youths in England &quot;
The extreme right is to blame for everything, because it tries to demonize the British Muslims &quot;
The eternal response to gaining time for the Judeo-Islamic plans against Europe and diluting the reactionary character of Europeans with eloquent phrases, bombastic and victimhood to do nothing.
They already did it with Spain many centuries ago, Moors and Jews allied against Europeans.
Then a brat kicks a sudaca and has to turn around the world, and diplomats by means.
The good thing about this issue is that it is creating more and more awareness and when there is awareness, the white prodefense sentiment of whites is becoming exponentially more and more and more it will be harder to hide this informational garbage.
The Internet is a real weapon against the system.
PS: Moors and Jews are Semitic, remember it.

The times I&#39;ve been through UK, those issues are blatantly censored.
The same as here, it is a matter of showing the population that immigrants are citizens of the first and if there is violence, crimes or similar produced by them is silent, if you can not is said to be an isolated case or apologize to the maximum Saying that if racism, etc, etc.
The case of the black Muslim who beheaded the soldier went almost unnoticed ... here I think the world opened cover talking about the moths of madrid ... By contrast when the video of the English that rustled on the metro against immigration, They put in jail and the news was in the average weeks in a row ...
These themes are becoming more common in Europe, the elite that govern knows, but their goal is to maximize the maximum possible immigration and therefore force the threshold of tolerance.
Let the perfidious Albion become annoying.
Now they can enjoy the multiculturalized, and what they have left to continue enjoying ...
I become more radicalized with these things.
And look that I was moderate.
But you can not tolerate getting a finger in the eye continuously without any reaction, and the politicians doing nothing.

An aggression of &quot;young Muslims&quot; to white girls provokes tensions in an English city (Video)
The broadcast of a video showing an aggression of young Pakistanis to white girls has generated great tension in Ashton-under-Lyne.
The video, which has already been removed from You Tube, can still be seen in Live-Leak.
Last week, several minors of both sexes who were at a bus stop in the Ashton town (on the outskirts of Manchester) were harassed and violently beaten by male &quot;British&quot; criminals of Pakistani origin armed with sticks.
The broadcast of the video on the Internet soon provoked outrage in Ashton and fears were triggered by a wave of unrest; However, there have been no incidents in the interracial zone.
Ghffar Hussain, an &quot;expert&quot; on terrorism issues, told the newspaper The Commentator that the incident is only a confrontation between &quot;gangs&quot; whose members have a lot of free time; Has also ensured that the religious question is oblivious to what happened and with Islamic self-confidence has been cackled: &quot;The extreme right is to blame for everything, because it tries to demonize the British Muslims.&quot;
LiveLeak.
With-Muslims attack White youths in England &quot;
The extreme right is to blame for everything, because it tries to demonize the British Muslims &quot;
The eternal response to gaining time for the Judeo-Islamic plans against Europe and diluting the reactionary character of Europeans with eloquent phrases, bombastic and victimhood to do nothing.
They already did it with Spain many centuries ago, Moors and Jews allied against Europeans.
Then a brat kicks a sudaca and has to turn around the world, and diplomats by means.
The good thing about this issue is that it is creating more and more awareness and when there is awareness, the white prodefense sentiment of whites is becoming exponentially more and more and more it will be harder to hide this informational garbage.
The Internet is a real weapon against the system.
PS: Moors and Jews are Semitic, remember it.

The times I&#39;ve been through UK, those issues are blatantly censored.
The same as here, it is a matter of showing the population that immigrants are citizens of the first and if there is violence, crimes or similar produced by them is silent, if you can not is said to be an isolated case or apologize to the maximum Saying that if racism, etc, etc.
The case of the black Muslim who beheaded the soldier went almost unnoticed ... here I think the world opened cover talking about the moths of madrid ... By contrast when the video of the English that rustled on the metro against immigration, They put in jail and the news was in the average weeks in a row ...
These themes are becoming more common in Europe, the elite that govern knows, but their goal is to maximize the maximum possible immigration and therefore force the threshold of tolerance.
Let the perfidious Albion become annoying.
Now they can enjoy the multiculturalized, and what they have left to continue enjoying ...
I become more radicalized with these things.
And look that I was moderate.
But you can not tolerate getting a finger in the eye continuously without any reaction, and the politicians doing nothing.

PERFECT to exepcion of death note (ke nose ke you see) and one piece (horrible) death note-blood + one piece-inuyasha
The best is EVANGELION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think the best ones are: one piece inuyasha dragon ball naruto vampire hunter saint seiya that&#39;s all (I think)
Top5
1.
- Evangelion 2.
- Ghost in the shell 3.
- Heroic Age 4.
- Carnival Robot 5.
- Ichi Zero
And whoever says otherwise is an ignoramus!
Someone has seen blood +
I have 20 .... my generation was from Saint Seiya and Dragon Ball
Now I see Naruto AND YA !!
New generations will vote for new anime ... and so
No poes in the end (although I do not know if the k I say are considered anime ?????)
1 _ dragon ball 2 _ saint seya and from here and they are given one piece, the simpson (for that of the commentary) the pink panter etc
Ah my goddess, onegai teacher, sandybell, heidy, dragon ball, full metal alchemist, naruto, one piece, sailor moon, bleach, knights of the zodiac, full metal panic!
Fumoffu, neon genesis evangelion,
Digimon shaman king Blood + Naruto (season 1) Death Note Evangelion Sailor MOON BLEACH ANIMATRIX
Yosi eh seen blood + although it is not very well known
The best I&#39;ve seen in my life is the Digimon, I loved it from the beginning ... there are five seasons ... adventures, adventures 2, tamers, frontier and saivors ... my favorite is advetures ... but The frontier so I like it ,,, the others are rather chafes and little interesting, I admit ... but still they do not stop impressing me ...
Digimon shaman king Blood + Naruto (season 1) Death Note Evangelion Sailor MOON BLEACH ANIMATRIX
Of course digimon is the best ... What is your favorite digimon ???
Mine is Lucemon ... he&#39;s one of the most powerful ... but I also like wargreymon.
And black.
Are great ... greetings ,,,
Evangelion&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All Products:
4 m3 m3 3nknt4 &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; p3r0 4 0tr0s q3 m3 guzt4n k0m0; Naruto, Deaht note, Blood +, Full Metal Alchemist, Bleach ... 3 nf the gr4n m4 ori4 ......
Viva NARUTO !!!
It&#39;s the best there is!!!
Poes for me there is nothing like dragon ball but there are michos and my criteria would also be the knights of the zodiac, naruto, inuyasha, samuray shamploo, samuray x and one pice and guess there is more
Ergo, Full metal alchemist is u_u, although I have never seen it.
I prefer DB and Pokemon xD
There are many but ps right now they are one piece naruto bleach without any order of major or minor the three beats me evenly
Not because m top 5 en 1 Rurouni kenshin 2 bleach 3 soul eater 4 FMA 5 death note
My favorite anime is, &quot;the knights of the zodiac&quot;, &quot;one piece&quot;, and of course the best .......... &quot;naruto&quot;
Dragon flay, that porcierto never passed the complete series algien knows in what ends?
Dragon flay, that porcierto never passed the complete series algien knows in what ends?

Death Note.
Saint Seya

MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA ABSURD OF NARCOTRAFICO, why do not they say it loud and clear like the accusations of 25 years ago?
I verify that the accusation corresponds to an AUTHENTICATED PHOTOCOPY of the accusation in the USA, which, worth mentioning, was one of the charges in which Manuel Noriega was acquitted, because the US Attorney&#39;s Office did not find enough proof that they linked the money In bank accounts with money derived from alleged drug trafficking.
Among the documents presented by the defense are: a letter from the US prosecutors informing the judge in Miami of his inability to link Noriega&#39;s money to the accusation; Letters of recognition of the DEA to the work led by Noriega in the fight against the drug traffic of dates 1983 to &#39;88; Testimonies of the CIA, where they also certify the cooperation of Noriega; Documents of secret agreements between the US Attorney&#39;s Office and the heads of the Cali Cartel and Medellin to reduce the sentence of witnesses in exchange for testimony against Noriega in the Miami trial and, in that vein, could continue to list documents with arguments that put in Evidence the principle of &#39;reasonable doubt&#39;, and I wonder ... Is it true then, that the &#39;French trick&#39; is to silence Noriega!
Panamanian, general of forces, former head of government and prisoner of war
---------- Post added Apr 24, 2015 at 8:49 pm ----------
Today the liar media still remember the former general of Panama Manuel Antonio Noriega painted it narcodictador and nothing was further from reality.
It was quite the opposite: Manuel Antonio Noriega fought against drug trafficking effectively and demonstrably.
It was at the time internationally recognized with official documents its effective fight against drug trafficking.
They wanted to insinuate to the families of the generation of the drugged eighty that the culprit was a dictator of a small state that instead did exactly the opposite: it fought effectively against the drug traffic.
(In the Panama of the eighties there was no generation drugged as in Europe and USA)
After the forced departure of the &quot;narcodictador&quot; by a military invasion of the American military forces that took 3000 innocent civilian victims, of Panamanians ...
All the narco money filled the Panamanian banks and the drug entered freely which was not seen before in the small republic of Panama.

  Trivia Dominoes: Play Off the Last Bit of Trivia   It's a game of my own devising and I expect the thread to sink beneath the horizon, but just in case, here's how it works: I'll post a piece of trivia, somebody will "play" off my trivia, then the next person tags onto that, etc., and let's see how we can keep it going.  Simple rules:  1- You should make sure it's true before using it to avoid "Cite?"  2- It should have something that can be played off both sides  3- You can decide what's trivia or factoid or whatever- it basically just means it should be blip sized information.  Here's how to play- imagine this is posted by several posters:   Poster 1: Mickey Rooney has the longest film career in history- 84 years to date with several projects in development.  Poster 2: Mickey Rooney was the original choice to play Archie Bunker.  Poster 3: Archie Bunker's chair is in the Smithsonian Institution.  Poster 4: The Smithsonian was founded with money willed to the U.S. by the illegitimate son of a British nobleman.  Poster 5: Omer Bhatti, the Norwegian rapper, is rumored to be the illegitimate son of Michael Jackson.  Poster 6: Michael Jackson's THRILLER was the best selling album of all time.  Poster 7: Enrico Caruso was the first singer to become a millionaire from recordings.  Poster 8: Enrico Caruso was in San Francisco during the 1906 earthquake.  Hopefully you get the idea- you can play off any part of the preceding piece of trivia. You can make a statement that is not necessarily true so long as you qualify it (i.e. I didn't say Bhatti is Jackson's son, just that he's rumored to be, which is true) or you can go for a "not exactly but really close" connection (Thriller setting records and Caruso's recording earnings are not exact matches but both have to do with distinctions in recording success, if that makes sense).  So, ready to play? I doubt it, but I've started threads that strangled on the cord before. I'll be back with a piece of trivia: play off any part of it so long as you keep the thread going.   TRIVIA:  Presidents Andrew Jackson, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Bill Clinton were all born after the death of their biological fathers.  reminder: you can play off Jackson, Hayes, Clinton, biological fathers, etc.   Rutherford B. Hayes is the only US president to have an entire province named after him in a country outside the US -- the Presidente Hayes Province in Paraguay.   nm   Paraguay is one of only two landlocked countries in South America, the other is Bolivia.   The Bolivian national football (soccer) team has never advanced beyond the first round of the World Cup.   In Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, our heroes want to escape to Bolivia, but it doesn't really work out.   No European team has ever won a world cup contested outside of Europe.   The first video honored at the MTV Europe awards was "Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe" by Whale.   The first video played on MTV was the Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star".    The first video played on MTV was the Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star".   Buggles Geoff Downes and Trevor Horne joined Yes in 1981.   One of the members of Yes was Steve Howe. A different Steve Howe pitched for the Los Angeles Dodgers.   Elias Howe invented the first practical sewing machine.   The Beatles' movie "Help!" is dedicated to Elias Howe.   Like "Help!," the TV show "Jeopardy!" has an exclamation point as part of the title.   Like "Help!" and "Jeopardy!", the TV series "Combat!" has an exclamation point as part of the title.    The punctuation mark combining an exclamation point with a question mark is called an interrobang.   Combat! star Vic Morrow was tragically killed on set of the movie The Twilight Zone when a helicopter crashed on top of him.    Combat! star Vic Morrow was tragically killed on set of the movie The Twilight Zone when a helicopter crashed on top of him.    Harrison Ford is a licensed helicopter pilot.   Harrison Ford's SO is Callista Flockhart.   Callista was a nymph who was transformed into a bear by Hera when she became pregnant by Zeus.   A plush toy bear, or "teddy bear" is so named because of former US President Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt.   Teddy Roosevelt is to be played by Leonardo DiCaprio in a film slated for a 2011 release.    Teddy Roosevelt is to be played by Leonardo DiCaprio in a film slated for a 2011 release.   Leonardo DiCaprio was named that because his mother first felt him kick while looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in a California museum.

  Trivia Dominoes: Play Off the Last Bit of Trivia   It's a game of my own devising and I expect the thread to sink beneath the horizon, but just in case, here's how it works: I'll post a piece of trivia, somebody will "play" off my trivia, then the next person tags onto that, etc., and let's see how we can keep it going.  Simple rules:  1- You should make sure it's true before using it to avoid "Cite?"  2- It should have something that can be played off both sides  3- You can decide what's trivia or factoid or whatever- it basically just means it should be blip sized information.  Here's how to play- imagine this is posted by several posters:   Poster 1: Mickey Rooney has the longest film career in history- 84 years to date with several projects in development.  Poster 2: Mickey Rooney was the original choice to play Archie Bunker.  Poster 3: Archie Bunker's chair is in the Smithsonian Institution.  Poster 4: The Smithsonian was founded with money willed to the U.S. by the illegitimate son of a British nobleman.  Poster 5: Omer Bhatti, the Norwegian rapper, is rumored to be the illegitimate son of Michael Jackson.  Poster 6: Michael Jackson's THRILLER was the best selling album of all time.  Poster 7: Enrico Caruso was the first singer to become a millionaire from recordings.  Poster 8: Enrico Caruso was in San Francisco during the 1906 earthquake.  Hopefully you get the idea- you can play off any part of the preceding piece of trivia. You can make a statement that is not necessarily true so long as you qualify it (i.e. I didn't say Bhatti is Jackson's son, just that he's rumored to be, which is true) or you can go for a "not exactly but really close" connection (Thriller setting records and Caruso's recording earnings are not exact matches but both have to do with distinctions in recording success, if that makes sense).  So, ready to play? I doubt it, but I've started threads that strangled on the cord before. I'll be back with a piece of trivia: play off any part of it so long as you keep the thread going.   TRIVIA:  Presidents Andrew Jackson, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Bill Clinton were all born after the death of their biological fathers.  reminder: you can play off Jackson, Hayes, Clinton, biological fathers, etc.   Rutherford B. Hayes is the only US president to have an entire province named after him in a country outside the US -- the Presidente Hayes Province in Paraguay.   nm   Paraguay is one of only two landlocked countries in South America, the other is Bolivia.   The Bolivian national football (soccer) team has never advanced beyond the first round of the World Cup.   In Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, our heroes want to escape to Bolivia, but it doesn't really work out.   No European team has ever won a world cup contested outside of Europe.   The first video honored at the MTV Europe awards was "Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe" by Whale.   The first video played on MTV was the Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star".    The first video played on MTV was the Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star".   Buggles Geoff Downes and Trevor Horne joined Yes in 1981.   One of the members of Yes was Steve Howe. A different Steve Howe pitched for the Los Angeles Dodgers.   Elias Howe invented the first practical sewing machine.   The Beatles' movie "Help!" is dedicated to Elias Howe.   Like "Help!," the TV show "Jeopardy!" has an exclamation point as part of the title.   Like "Help!" and "Jeopardy!", the TV series "Combat!" has an exclamation point as part of the title.    The punctuation mark combining an exclamation point with a question mark is called an interrobang.   Combat! star Vic Morrow was tragically killed on set of the movie The Twilight Zone when a helicopter crashed on top of him.    Combat! star Vic Morrow was tragically killed on set of the movie The Twilight Zone when a helicopter crashed on top of him.    Harrison Ford is a licensed helicopter pilot.   Harrison Ford's SO is Callista Flockhart.   Callista was a nymph who was transformed into a bear by Hera when she became pregnant by Zeus.   A plush toy bear, or "teddy bear" is so named because of former US President Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt.   Teddy Roosevelt is to be played by Leonardo DiCaprio in a film slated for a 2011 release.    Teddy Roosevelt is to be played by Leonardo DiCaprio in a film slated for a 2011 release.   Leonardo DiCaprio was named that because his mother first felt him kick while looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in a California museum.

It doesn't specifically list Office 2011 (the Mac version) in the list of what can be viewed. I assume this is important for Mac users?   Um-m-m-m, no. There is no unique Office 2011 format.

I know from using both 2010 and 2011 editions extensively (the first at my regular workplace, the second in my freelance editing work) that they definitely do behave differently in certain ways. That's why I find it odd - on an Apple forum no less - that the 2011 edition isn't mentioned.

It doesn't specifically list Office 2011 (the Mac version) in the list of what can be viewed. I assume this is important for Mac users?   Um-m-m-m, no. There is no unique Office 2011 format.

I know from using both 2010 and 2011 editions extensively (the first at my regular workplace, the second in my freelance editing work) that they definitely do behave differently in certain ways. That's why I find it odd - on an Apple forum no less - that the 2011 edition isn't mentioned.

I'm not sure whether you're asking because you're just genuinely curious, or because of whether you wonder what your chances are wrt admission quotas and all, or because of prior perception people usually have about internationals who stick to themselves and don't mix...but like Zotts says, it doesn't matter (or well, if it does matter to you at present...it really shouldn't.) International students come in all types, from the social ones to the hermit-esque ones.

  Is Imperial mostly international students?   Is Imperial mostly international students? About how many are English and how many are internationals?   http://www.thecompleteuniversityguid...by-university/ claims 36.2%  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ukne...e-foreign.html - not sure if that ever came to be.  Wiki says that in 2007-08, " 29% of all full-time students come from outside the European Union. "   Thanks for the statistics   Can anyone who goes to Imperial back this up?   I go to Imperial but I don't know exactly how many students are international. I don't really go around asking who is a British student and who isn't. There do seem to be a lot of international students, and those stats look about right. Hard to say though. Everyone is very cool though .  Does it really matter?   I'm also an Imperialite, and - le gasp! - one of those Marmite-esque internationals (well, it depends on how you perceive my cohort.)  I'm not sure whether you're asking because you're just genuinely curious, or because of whether you wonder what your chances are wrt admission quotas and all, or because of prior perception people usually have about internationals who stick to themselves and don't mix...but like Zotts says, it doesn't matter (or well, if it does matter to you at present...it really shouldn't.) International students come in all types, from the social ones to the hermit-esque ones. As for admissions/quotas, you just have to prove you're head and shoulders above all the other Toms, Dicks and Harrys who apply.  Also sometimes there seem to be more internationals than there really are, because people forget not all Asians/Indians/etc who go to Imperial are from overseas. Don't forget the British-born-and-bred peeps who pay home fees!  PS// The Telegraph article never came to be.      ^did I just see a post number of 9,999,999?

Can someone explain it to me?
The citizen of Colombia Mr. Felipe Gonzalez Marquez, has gone to put his excelentisamas and illustrative Nose to Venezuela and I just saw in Telemandril the Minister of AA EE of Spain giving him protection in the Embassy of Spain in Venezuela, what the hell is this?
That shit of Expresidente of the Government of Spain, has been nationalized in Colombia predicting the salad of ostias that can fall to him in Spain and possible fugitive of the Justice?
Someone or somebody can illustrate to me what consequences it can have for Spain that a Colombian citizen of Spanish origin should put his noses where he should not with the approval of the Spanish chancellor.
- Health
I imagine he has dual nationality.
What I ask myself is because they go around defending opponents why they do not defend this one to put an example:
Raif Badawi, the Saudi blogger who was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for creating a liberal forum in &quot;Free Saudi Liberals&quot; to discuss the role of religion in the kingdom, could now face the death penalty , The British newspaper The Independent reported Sunday.
The wife of the blogger, Ensaf Haidar, told the British newspaper that Saudi Arabia&#39;s claim to justice is for Badawi to &quot;go through a new trial for apostasy.&quot; &quot;
If found guilty, would face a death sentence, &quot;the newspaper said.
Haidar pointed out that this information had been transmitted to him by &quot;official sources&quot; of the Saudi kingdom.
The newspaper recalls that in 2013 a judge dismissed the accusation of apostasy against the 31-year-old blogger after asserting that he was a Muslim.
The evidence against Badawi was based, in part, on a &quot;Like&quot; Facebook on a page for Christian Arabs.
Badawi, currently in prison, has only received 50 of 1,000 lashes, has had to be postponed for &quot;medical reasons.&quot;
Ah, they would not even let him enter the country and just open his mouth about these other opponents of the Golfa area, we are fucking the businesses of the Spanish caste.
Illuminated Mayan who does not know the effects of double nationality comes, shit your legal shit and leave yourself a pestilent rest.

I&#39;ll explain it to you in your own words.
The citizen of Spain, Mr EQUIS (another equis), puts his most excellent and most illustrious Nose to Spain.
That shit of EQUIS of the Government of Venezuela, nationalized in Spain predicting the salad of ostias that can fall in Venezuela and possible fugitive of Justice?
The consequences that can have for Venezuela that a Spanish citizen of Venezuelan nationalization put the noses where it should not with the approval of the Venezuelan chancellor are summarized in MISSION COMPLIED.
- More health
And callaitos that before we all supported that Don González did.
Very well managed by those affected, yes sir.
To see who protests in Spain because the Venezuelans do the same.
The ETA members, the mobsters and the narcos will be clapping their ears.
If they put him in jail, they would prove that he would raise us SIGLOS of advantage

Taxes: The states undertake to automatically exchange information on tax matters
OECD-Paris, May 6, 2014
Banking secrecy for fiscal purposes is coming to an end because countries, along with major financial centers, have committed to the automatic exchange of information between jurisdictions.
The Declaration on the Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters was approved by the 34 member countries of the OECD during the annual meeting of the Ministerial Council in Paris.
Other countries such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Africa also adopted the Declaration.
The Declaration commits countries to implement a new single global standard in the automatic exchange of information.
The standard was developed by the OECD and was accepted by the G-20 finance ministers last February.
The rule obliges countries and their jurisdictions to obtain all financial information from their fiscal institutions and to exchange this information automatically with other jurisdictions on an annual basis.
The OECD will deliver a detailed comment on the new standard as well as technical solutions to implement exchanges of real information during a meeting of G-20 finance ministers in September 2014.
WE, THE MINISTERS AND REPRESENTATIVES of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, , India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain , Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union;
1.
DECLARE that we are determined to tackle cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion and to promote international tax compliance through mutual administrative assistance in tax matters and a level playing field;
2.
CONFIRM that automatic exchange of financial information will further these objectives particularly if the new global standard, including full transparency on ownership interests, is implemented among all financial centers
The OECD agrees to break bank secrecy
- Switzerland and Singapore formally leave the blacklist of tax havens aligned with the criteria of fiscal transparency imposed by the United States.
- The financial capital of the banks will not accept money without the prior declaration of &quot;taxes paid&quot;, made under the responsibility, including the criminal, of the client.
With the agreement, which will be fully operational in 2017 Switzerland and Singapore, have committed to reveal the financial situation of the depositors to the countries (especially the prosecuting authorities) of origin
The OECD agrees to break bank secrecy
The 32 countries that make up the OECD are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Chile, Rep. Of Korea, Denmark, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Netherlands , Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.
Accessed are Slovenia, Estonia, Israel and Russia, while reinforced cooperation with Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and South Africa was initiated.
32 puffs that are going to pay with their taxes the wars of aggression against those who produce raw materials.
That United States and Anglo-Americanism, speak and demand fiscal transparency, having one of those paradises on every island of the commonwealth ... is of traca.
Switzerland has never been a tax haven.
The fellow confused bank secrecy with tax haven.
The Holy Alliance of embezzlers wants to continue squeezing the sudbito.
There we have the Falciani list that only those who have left it have seen to move the money to another place outside the homeland treasury.
We are still waiting to know the members or the minor to know the actions taken against members of the Falciani list.
And if the Minister of Finance of Spain signing that is personal friend of Bárcenas and the &quot;other high position of the PP with accounts in Switzerland&quot;, to what comes his joy and promptness in signing.

Taxes: The states undertake to automatically exchange information on tax matters
OECD-Paris, May 6, 2014
Banking secrecy for fiscal purposes is coming to an end because countries, along with major financial centers, have committed to the automatic exchange of information between jurisdictions.
The Declaration on the Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters was approved by the 34 member countries of the OECD during the annual meeting of the Ministerial Council in Paris.
Other countries such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Africa also adopted the Declaration.
The Declaration commits countries to implement a new single global standard in the automatic exchange of information.
The standard was developed by the OECD and was accepted by the G-20 finance ministers last February.
The rule obliges countries and their jurisdictions to obtain all financial information from their fiscal institutions and to exchange this information automatically with other jurisdictions on an annual basis.
The OECD will deliver a detailed comment on the new standard as well as technical solutions to implement exchanges of real information during a meeting of G-20 finance ministers in September 2014.
WE, THE MINISTERS AND REPRESENTATIVES of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, , India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain , Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union;
1.
DECLARE that we are determined to tackle cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion and to promote international tax compliance through mutual administrative assistance in tax matters and a level playing field;
2.
CONFIRM that automatic exchange of financial information will further these objectives particularly if the new global standard, including full transparency on ownership interests, is implemented among all financial centers
The OECD agrees to break bank secrecy
- Switzerland and Singapore formally leave the blacklist of tax havens aligned with the criteria of fiscal transparency imposed by the United States.
- The financial capital of the banks will not accept money without the prior declaration of &quot;taxes paid&quot;, made under the responsibility, including the criminal, of the client.
With the agreement, which will be fully operational in 2017 Switzerland and Singapore, have committed to reveal the financial situation of the depositors to the countries (especially the prosecuting authorities) of origin
The OECD agrees to break bank secrecy
The 32 countries that make up the OECD are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Chile, Rep. Of Korea, Denmark, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Netherlands , Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.
Accessed are Slovenia, Estonia, Israel and Russia, while reinforced cooperation with Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and South Africa was initiated.
32 puffs that are going to pay with their taxes the wars of aggression against those who produce raw materials.
That United States and Anglo-Americanism, speak and demand fiscal transparency, having one of those paradises on every island of the commonwealth ... is of traca.
Switzerland has never been a tax haven.
The fellow confused bank secrecy with tax haven.
The Holy Alliance of embezzlers wants to continue squeezing the sudbito.

About supposed avalanches of Mexicans in the US: negative balance between 2009 and 2014
We tend to think that Mexicans do not stop entering the US. And the words of eg Donald Trump go in that direction.
That is why it surprises that in the last 5 years they are leaving the USA. More Mexican than those who enter.
Mexicans leave the United States: Mexican immigration to US falls to 15-year lows | Contact Us | The pa
It would be interesting to know the number of Americans leaving the US to go to other countries.
There are some thousands of graduates who can not pay their life-seeking student debts in Latin America, and Asia, in addition to retirees, who can not afford their medical treatment, and find that their pension gives a lot of money in Costa Rica , Panama, Ecuador ... and the medical treatment, if they pay, is much lower than in the US, and not bad.
Even so, the influx of immigrants is positive for the US.

Of course.
Maybe there would be a surprise, although given the size of the US. I imagine that they emigrated less than in other parts of the world (because they are already migrating to another state of their own country).
LEGAL immigration ... tlcjns .... also we know the country the lies on which side throws them ...
Anyway you who are a negricist should not praise the Mexicans much because the Mexicans black you to the minimum ...

Many of those who enter the Mexican border are not Mexicans.
Statistical trick: official data can only reflect the Mexicans who are legally in the country, since they do not know how many illegal there are or where they are at any moment.
If I do not legalize new people, but some are leaving the country, for few people who are leaving, the data says there is a decline.
Anyway, there is one thing to point out: the reason Trump criticizes immigration, the reason why in the US they openly talk about expelling illegal immigrants, etc .; Is that they have managed to reach the birth rate of 2 children per woman.
So they do not need more people.

Effectively.
The one with bocachancladas that have released the usual ones here.

I do not know what&#39;s coming.
On the other hand the average Mexican, first I doubt that there is something that we can call &quot;average&quot;, second is recognized by the brunette complexion.
From there, it can have brown complexion and features more Spanish or Indian.

Well, I&#39;ve been to Mexico, specifically in Guadalajara, and I would not say that the average Mexican can pass through Spanish, maybe 30% of the population if, but the rest does not.

About supposed avalanches of Mexicans in the US: negative balance between 2009 and 2014
We tend to think that Mexicans do not stop entering the US. And the words of eg Donald Trump go in that direction.
That is why it surprises that in the last 5 years they are leaving the USA. More Mexican than those who enter.
Mexicans leave the United States: Mexican immigration to US falls to 15-year lows | Contact Us | The pa
It would be interesting to know the number of Americans leaving the US to go to other countries.
There are some thousands of graduates who can not pay their life-seeking student debts in Latin America, and Asia, in addition to retirees, who can not afford their medical treatment, and find that their pension gives a lot of money in Costa Rica , Panama, Ecuador ... and the medical treatment, if they pay, is much lower than in the US, and not bad.
Even so, the influx of immigrants is positive for the US.

Of course.
Maybe there would be a surprise, although given the size of the US. I imagine that they emigrated less than in other parts of the world (because they are already migrating to another state of their own country).
LEGAL immigration ... tlcjns .... also we know the country the lies on which side throws them ...
Anyway you who are a negricist should not praise the Mexicans much because the Mexicans black you to the minimum ...

Many of those who enter the Mexican border are not Mexicans.
Statistical trick: official data can only reflect the Mexicans who are legally in the country, since they do not know how many illegal there are or where they are at any moment.
If I do not legalize new people, but some are leaving the country, for few people who are leaving, the data says there is a decline.
Anyway, there is one thing to point out: the reason Trump criticizes immigration, the reason why in the US they openly talk about expelling illegal immigrants, etc .; Is that they have managed to reach the birth rate of 2 children per woman.
So they do not need more people.
The data is of the net migratory balance absolutely nothing to do with legal immigration or illegal, nowadays there are more Central Americans than own Mexicans crossing the Rio Bravo

Effectively.
The one with bocachancladas that have released the usual ones here.

I do not know what&#39;s coming.
On the other hand the average Mexican, first I doubt that there is something that we can call &quot;average&quot;, second is recognized by the brunette complexion.
From there, it can have brown complexion and features more Spanish or Indian.

Well, I&#39;ve been to Mexico, specifically in Guadalajara, and I would not say that the average Mexican can pass through Spanish, maybe 30% of the population if, but the rest does not.

What is Europe?
A continent?
It does not meet the geographical requirements for this: the Eastern separation with Asia is artificial and Russia overflowed it from medieval times; Southern separation is called into question as Georgia and Armenia consider themselves European nations and Europe reluctantly recognizes them as such (as well as the Muslim nation of Azerbaijan).
And I question the definition of &quot;cultural continent&quot;: is it that the culture of a Yemeni has the closest resemblance to that of a Korean?
Is Christianity, as understood by Juan Luis Vives?
Christianity overflows the European continent and is also majority in the American continent, Australia and New Zealand; Has a strong presence in Africa (including peoples who were already Christians long before European colonization, such as the Coptic Egyptians and the Ethiopian nation) and are not lacking in the Asian subcontinent (Georgia, Armenia, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, the Philippines and Supposed Siberia, but also China, India ...).
Similarly, the presence of Islam is not alien to the European continent: Albania, which was born as a Christian nation and still has an important Christian minority, was Islamized in the Ottoman period (as well as a part of Bosnia-Herzegovina); The Tatars remain loyal to the Russians but were never converted to Christianity; Thrace is Muslim in Turkey and has Muslim minorities in Greece and Bulgaria; The Ciscaucasia is geographically European and of Islamic religion ...
Also, Buddhism is the majority religion of the European region of Kalmukia, and to force Europe to identify with Christianity is to deny the contributions made to its culture by Andalusian Muslims, Jews of the Sephardic and Ashkenazic branches and, of course, Greco-Roman pagans and , To a lesser extent, Slavs, Celts and Germans.
Not to mention that many Europeans today are atheists (in the Czech Republic they are majority).
Race?
Hungarians are not Aryans, nor are Finns, Lapps, Komis, Bulgarians or Tatars (among other European peoples).
Is it a nation?
Obviously not and the many wars between two or several nations in Europe prove this.
Is it a culture?
The same culture as that of the elites of the Americas, Australia and New Zealand.
In the end, I&#39;m not clear what Europe is.

Race?
Hungarians are not Aryans, nor are Finns, Lapps, Komis, Bulgarians, Gypsies or Tatars (among other European peoples).
Arius = noble, not a race, in fact it is a concept that was born in Asia.
Anyone on the planet can be Aryan except for pure black people.
Europe is a sub-race and a culture, that is why it is in dismantling, because its differential fact is in harassment and demolition.
The separation of Africa and Asia is also artificial, do we also consider the same continent?
Both contients (Africa and Asia) have different religions, races and cultures respectively, are less continents for it?
Does anybody put a Yemeni in the same bag as a Japanese?
Are they both Asian?
To a Moroccan and a Pygmy?
Go close the thread.

Go close the thread.
The separation between Asia and Africa (and that of North America and South America) is much less artificial than the Eurasian one.
It is even located on a plate different from that of the bulk of Asia and Europe (belonging to the Eurasian, Arabic and Indo-Australian plate, as well as other smaller ones.
But come on, that from Ireland to China is mostly Eurasian plate).

Europe takes its entire history (from the Ostrogothic invasion of Italy) by scrapping and rejoining itself.

Also, Buddhism is the majority religion of the European region of Kalmukia, and to force Europe to identify with Christianity is to deny the contributions made to its culture by Andalusian Muslims, Jews of the Sephardic and Ashkenazic branches and, of course, Greco-Roman pagans and , To a lesser extent, Slavs, Celts and Germans.

What is Europe?
A continent?
It does not meet the geographical requirements for this: the Eastern separation with Asia is artificial and Russia overflowed it from medieval times; Southern separation is called into question as Georgia and Armenia consider themselves European nations and Europe reluctantly recognizes them as such (as well as the Muslim nation of Azerbaijan).
And I question the definition of &quot;cultural continent&quot;: is it that the culture of a Yemeni has the closest resemblance to that of a Korean?
Is Christianity, as understood by Juan Luis Vives?
Christianity overflows the European continent and is also majority in the American continent, Australia and New Zealand; Has a strong presence in Africa (including peoples who were already Christians long before European colonization, such as the Coptic Egyptians and the Ethiopian nation) and are not lacking in the Asian subcontinent (Georgia, Armenia, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, the Philippines and Supposed Siberia, but also China, India ...).
Similarly, the presence of Islam is not alien to the European continent: Albania, which was born as a Christian nation and still has an important Christian minority, was Islamized in the Ottoman period (as well as a part of Bosnia-Herzegovina); The Tatars remain loyal to the Russians but were never converted to Christianity; Thrace is Muslim in Turkey and has Muslim minorities in Greece and Bulgaria; The Ciscaucasia is geographically European and of Islamic religion ...
Also, Buddhism is the majority religion of the European region of Kalmukia, and to force Europe to identify with Christianity is to deny the contributions made to its culture by Andalusian Muslims, Jews of the Sephardic and Ashkenazic branches and, of course, Greco-Roman pagans and , To a lesser extent, Slavs, Celts and Germans.
Not to mention that many Europeans today are atheists (in the Czech Republic they are majority).
Race?
Hungarians are not Aryans, nor are Finns, Lapps, Komis, Bulgarians or Tatars (among other European peoples).
Is it a nation?
Obviously not and the many wars between two or several nations in Europe prove this.
Is it a culture?
The same culture as that of the elites of the Americas, Australia and New Zealand.
In the end, I&#39;m not clear what Europe is.

Race?
Hungarians are not Aryans, nor are Finns, Lapps, Komis, Bulgarians, Gypsies or Tatars (among other European peoples).
Arius = noble, not a race, in fact it is a concept that was born in Asia.
Anyone on the planet can be Aryan except for pure black people.
Europe is a sub-race and a culture, that is why it is in dismantling, because its differential fact is in harassment and demolition.
The separation of Africa and Asia is also artificial, do we also consider the same continent?
Both contients (Africa and Asia) have different religions, races and cultures respectively, are less continents for it?
Does anybody put a Yemeni in the same bag as a Japanese?
Are they both Asian?
To a Moroccan and a Pygmy?
Go close the thread.

Go close the thread.
The separation between Asia and Africa (and that of North America and South America) is much less artificial than the Eurasian one.
It is even located on a plate different from that of the bulk of Asia and Europe (belonging to the Eurasian, Arabic and Indo-Australian plate, as well as other smaller ones.
But come on, that from Ireland to China is mostly Eurasian plate).

Europe takes its entire history (from the Ostrogothic invasion of Italy) by scrapping and rejoining itself.

Scientist JM Mulet manipulates a study of the OCU in his latest book to attack organic farmers
The scientist JM Mulet, ardent advocate of transgenic food and always ready to mock common agricultural practices, is able to go so far as to deliberately misinterpret scientific studies to defend his cause and attack his opponents, in this case a Evil as organic farming.
This is demonstrated in the example I will present below.
In Chapter 3 of his latest book, Eat Without Fear, an undisclosed frontal attack on sustainable agriculture disguised as a pro-skeptic book, Mulet writes the following regarding an OCU study on pesticide contamination of organic food: Consumer magazine did an analysis and found remains of pesticides unauthorized in organic production in 21 percent of the samples.
This figure is so high if we consider that, for example, for all Catalonia there are only 10 inspectors; Of course, and you have to believe that they will be good and will comply with the regulations.
That is to say, according to Mulet, the remains of pesticides found in 21% of the organic food analyzed show that organic farmers are liars and soulless people who, as far as they can circumvent the inspectors, use pesticides banned by the organic farming regulations , On the other hand, of legal use, but that if they are used in foods then these can not be labeled as ecological).
Is this interpretation true?
To find out, we have only to go directly to the analysis of OCU to see if these conclusions are really correct.
If we read the article, we notice two very interesting things: The first, which are 33 ecological food analyzed, a sample very unrepresentative of the wide variety that exists of these products; The second, which motivates this article, is found directly in the conclusions of the OCU study, where the analysts themselves indicate: The small amounts of residues detected in six of these seven organic foods could be due to involuntary causes: contaminations Crosses in the crop or in the process of elaboration, or insufficient periods of reconversion of the conventional crop to the ecological one.
That is to say, contrary to what Mulet writes in the book, the remains of pesticides indicate a possible case of involuntary contamination by nearby traditional crops, and not a deliberate attempt by the ecological farmers to enrich themselves at the expense of their consumers .
It seems to me very significant that in a book in which so much pseudoscience is attacked (something with which I totally agree) and it defends so fervor the objectivity and the scientific analysis has been committed this so flagrant manipulation of the reader.
Because the alternative to think that this is a mistake of Mulet when interpreting a simple study is completely naive considering that we are talking about a professor of biotechnology with a good career as a scientist.
If I publish this text under anonymity, it is porquel, although paradoxical, there is a lot of sectarianism and persecution to the voices minimally critical among the Spanish scientific community.
Always critical
I give the link, but nothing appears ...
The paradox of organic farming is that it is unsustainable, at least for a population like today.
Products for the rich.
Curious, because Mulet usually states that for example studies on the non-degradation of glyphosate (one of the most pernicious factors of Monsanto&#39;s transgenic crops, to my knowledge, glyphosate is involved in neural malformations in Argentine chicks) are false or Wrong
When interested, herbicides degrade themselves, if not, no.

Buff a little ostia.

The media are echoing: Russia imposes sanctions on Turkey for the downing of one of its fighter-bombers | Contact Us | THE WORLD
Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey on Saturday for the demolition of the Russian suz-24 fighter on the Turkish-Syrian border. Russian President Vladimir Putin has today signed a decree aimed at guaranteeing national security and involving economic sanctions against Turkey.
Thus, imports of certain products from Turkey are banned and the activity of companies under Turkish jurisdiction is suspended, according to AP.
In addition, Russia has already announced that it will suspend the visa-free regime with Turkey from 1 January 2016 and has recommended that Russians who do not travel there and those already in the country return as soon as possible.
The visa waiver agreement was signed by the governments of both countries in 2010 and entered into force in April 2011, triggering the flow of Russian tourists to Turkey, which became their second destination after Egypt.
According to Russia, if its citizens stop traveling to Turkey the tourism sector of that country will lose up to 10 billion dollars annually (9.4 billion euros), a figure equivalent to the Turkish surplus in trade between the two countries.
On the other hand, the Syrian army has denounced that during the last night several mortar shells &quot;against our positions&quot; were launched from the Turkish side of the border.
The information has been disseminated through a statement from the Turkish Army General Staff, which also ensures that alleged shipments of humanitarian aid are being used to cover the transport of weapons.
Tension on the Syrian-Turkish border has increased markedly in recent days following the downing of a Russian military aircraft by Turkey.
Russia, along with Iran, is the main ally of Syrian President Bashar Asad&#39;s regime in the fight against jihadist insurgent groups.
On the economic sanctions of Russia to Turkey, I already had the perception that Turkey was a great tourist destination of the Russians, and I see in wikipedia, that the Russians are the second after the Germans:
Top 10 countries whose residents provided the most visits to Turkey (2014 est.)
Germany 5.0 million Russia 2.5 million United Kingdom 2.5 million Bulgaria 1.5 million Georgia 1.4 million Netherlands 1.2 million ......

Little bocachanclas ladybugs are Putin and the Russians.
To see where the little eggs have the little ones like raisins they have to prove sometime when they face the Americans and NATO.
They are a panda of motherfuckers who are cowardly and miserable.
They just knocked Turkey down a plane on their fucking face and they come with economic sanctions.
Losers, they only dare with the weak like the poor Ukrainians who are murdering and stealing their land.
Bitch Russia.
Country to eliminate from the face of the earth.

well done.
I think that is better deal with those of the ISIS attacking in tourist hotels.
Buff a little ostia.

On December 3-4 the Turkish-Russian ministers will be in Belgrade.
Let&#39;s see if anything happens.

The media are echoing: Russia imposes sanctions on Turkey for the downing of one of its fighter-bombers | Contact Us | THE WORLD
Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey on Saturday for the demolition of the Russian suz-24 fighter on the Turkish-Syrian border. Russian President Vladimir Putin has today signed a decree aimed at guaranteeing national security and involving economic sanctions against Turkey.
Thus, imports of certain products from Turkey are banned and the activity of companies under Turkish jurisdiction is suspended, according to AP.
In addition, Russia has already announced that it will suspend the visa-free regime with Turkey from 1 January 2016 and has recommended that Russians who do not travel there and those already in the country return as soon as possible.
The visa waiver agreement was signed by the governments of both countries in 2010 and entered into force in April 2011, triggering the flow of Russian tourists to Turkey, which became their second destination after Egypt.
According to Russia, if its citizens stop traveling to Turkey the tourism sector of that country will lose up to 10 billion dollars annually (9.4 billion euros), a figure equivalent to the Turkish surplus in trade between the two countries.
On the other hand, the Syrian army has denounced that during the last night several mortar shells &quot;against our positions&quot; were launched from the Turkish side of the border.
The information has been disseminated through a statement from the Turkish Army General Staff, which also ensures that alleged shipments of humanitarian aid are being used to cover the transport of weapons.
Tension on the Syrian-Turkish border has increased markedly in recent days following the downing of a Russian military aircraft by Turkey.
Russia, along with Iran, is the main ally of Syrian President Bashar Asad&#39;s regime in the fight against jihadist insurgent groups.
On the economic sanctions of Russia to Turkey, I already had the perception that Turkey was a great tourist destination of the Russians, and I see in wikipedia, that the Russians are the second after the Germans:
Top 10 countries whose residents provided the most visits to Turkey (2014 est.)
Germany 5.0 million Russia 2.5 million United Kingdom 2.5 million Bulgaria 1.5 million Georgia 1.4 million Netherlands 1.2 million ......

Little bocachanclas ladybugs are Putin and the Russians.
To see where the little eggs have the little ones like raisins they have to prove sometime when they face the Americans and NATO.
They are a panda of motherfuckers who are cowardly and miserable.
They just knocked Turkey down a plane on their fucking face and they come with economic sanctions.
Losers, they only dare with the weak like the poor Ukrainians who are murdering and stealing their land.
Bitch Russia.
Country to eliminate from the face of the earth.
